I wonder why you and me fight each other
Don't you see the similarities between us?
Take a minute and see yourself in the mirror
You look like me: those eyes, lips - you can't deny
Have you thought about
Why we look the same?
Why we feel the same?
Don't tell me it's by chance
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
We're one big family
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
Just one big family
It doesn't matter if you live far away from me
You feel I feel, you bleed I bleed, you cry and I cry
We sleep and dream
Sometimes we're sad, sometimes we're happy
You breathe I breathe
We love, walk, talk and we smile
Have you thought about
Why we look the same?
Why we feel the same?
Don't tell me it's by chance
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
We're one big family
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
Just one big family
I care about you
And I wish you could realise
There's no difference between us two
We're part of one family
No matter how far you are
And even if we don’t know each other
Oh, you and me, me and you, we are one
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
We're one big family
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
Just one big family

                                            There’s a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there’s no need to cry. In this place you’ll feel there’s no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why, there’s a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.
Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.
Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

Dear Tiara
I’m so glad knowing that you will come here next holiday. It’s been almost two years we haven’t met each other since our graduation. I miss you so much.
Any way, we have a new park. It is a beautiful place to hang out with friends and family. If you come here, I will take you there.
You said you would go by train. However, I don’t know when you will come here exactly. Please tell me the time, so I can pick you up at the railway station.
O.K, that’s all for you now. Please reply soon. Send my love to your parents.

judul lagu ini adalah
I can see the pain living in your eyes
And I know how hard you try
You deserve to have so much more
I can feel your heart and I sympathize
And I'll never criticize
All you've ever meant to my life
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to lead you on
I don't want to hold you back
From where you might belong
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say but goodbye
You deserve the chance at the kind of love
I'm not sure I'm worthy of
Losing you is painful to me
I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna lead you on
I don't wanna hold you back
From where you might belong
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say, but goodbye
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to try
Though it's gonna hurt us both
There's no other way than to say
(Goodbye)

                                            There’s a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there’s no need to cry. In this place you’ll feel there’s no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why, there’s a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.
Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.
Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me

                                            Welcome to my world that's painted with sadness
There's no light of sun There you can't hear any sound at all
Here I'm waiting silently for you, father
Why you were so cruel to left poor Mary alone?
lalala...
Please take me away, I desperately promise to be a good girl, to be worthy of your love
I don't need the paint books, the dolls and the dresses,
Just tell me, why you've left your pictures and gone?
lalala...
Who are you, stranger with a red rose in your hand
I liked you from the first sight, I wanna be your friend, Let's play
I've never asked for this place that's called my home,
But hope, you will be staying with me until the end
lalala...
Please, don't be scared of me I'm a good girl
I just want to be with you to forget my sorrow 
I'm tired of being the puppet of this world
Oh, tell me, why do you want to go with this man?
lalala...
Is he your true knight in the shining armor?
Who'll sacrifice himself just for your sake with no fear But then
Why he resembles the one, who created
This gallery and picture, that gave me a birth?
lalala... 
MY TEARS ARE FALLING, WHY IT'S SO PAINFUL?
I DID NOTHING WRONG, SO WHY DO YOU HATE ME SO MUCH?
THIS BURNING CANVAS BECAME YOUR CRUEL ANSWER
AND NOW FLAMES UNSPARINGLY KISS ME GOODNIGHT.
lalala...
Welcome to her world that's lying in ashes...
There's a sea of fire, There is no way to run at all...
She only wanted to be with her father...
But little Mary is melting in her abyss alone...
"I'm coming, father..."

                            3. "One Big Family"
I wonder why you and me fight each other
Don't you see the similarities between us?
Take a minute and see yourself in the mirror
You look like me: those eyes, lips - you can't deny
Have you thought about
Why we look the same?
Why we feel the same?
Don't tell me it's by chance
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
We're one big family
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
Just one big family
It doesn't matter if you live far away from me
You feel I feel, you bleed I bleed, you cry and I cry
We sleep and dream
Sometimes we're sad, sometimes we're happy
You breathe I breathe
We love, walk, talk and we smile
Have you thought about
Why we look the same?
Why we feel the same?
Don't tell me it's by chance
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
We're one big family
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
Just one big family
I care about you
And I wish you could realise
There's no difference between us two
We're part of one family
No matter how far you are
And even if we don’t know each other
Oh, you and me, me and you, we are one
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
We're one big family
Oh, you're my brother
You're my sister
Just one big family

                            4. There’s a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there’s no need to cry. In this place you’ll feel there’s no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why, there’s a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.
Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.
Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

Dear Tiara
I’m so glad knowing that you will come here next holiday. It’s been almost two years we haven’t met each other since our graduation. I miss you so much.
Any way, we have a new park. It is a beautiful place to hang out with friends and family. If you come here, I will take you there.
You said you would go by train. However, I don’t know when you will come here exactly. Please tell me the time, so I can pick you up at the railway station.
O.K, that’s all for you now. Please reply soon. Send my love to your parents.
Love
Donita

judul lagu ini adalah
I can see the pain living in your eyes
And I know how hard you try
You deserve to have so much more
I can feel your heart and I sympathize
And I'll never criticize
All you've ever meant to my life
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to lead you on
I don't want to hold you back
From where you might belong
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say but goodbye
You deserve the chance at the kind of love
I'm not sure I'm worthy of
Losing you is painful to me
I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna lead you on
I don't wanna hold you back
From where you might belong
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say, but goodbye
You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to try
Though it's gonna hurt us both
There's no other way than to say
(Goodbye)

                            38. There’s a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there’s no need to cry. In this place you’ll feel there’s no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why, there’s a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.
Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.
Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me

                            40. Welcome to my world that's painted with sadness
There's no light of sun There you can't hear any sound at all
Here I'm waiting silently for you, father
Why you were so cruel to left poor Mary alone?
lalala...
Please take me away, I desperately promise to be a good girl, to be worthy of your love
I don't need the paint books, the dolls and the dresses,
Just tell me, why you've left your pictures and gone?
lalala...
Who are you, stranger with a red rose in your hand
I liked you from the first sight, I wanna be your friend, Let's play
I've never asked for this place that's called my home,
But hope, you will be staying with me until the end
lalala...
Please, don't be scared of me I'm a good girl
I just want to be with you to forget my sorrow 
I'm tired of being the puppet of this world
Oh, tell me, why do you want to go with this man?
lalala...
Is he your true knight in the shining armor?
Who'll sacrifice himself just for your sake with no fear But then
Why he resembles the one, who created
This gallery and picture, that gave me a birth?
lalala... 
MY TEARS ARE FALLING, WHY IT'S SO PAINFUL?
I DID NOTHING WRONG, SO WHY DO YOU HATE ME SO MUCH?
THIS BURNING CANVAS BECAME YOUR CRUEL ANSWER
AND NOW FLAMES UNSPARINGLY KISS ME GOODNIGHT.
lalala...
Welcome to her world that's lying in ashes...
There's a sea of fire, There is no way to run at all...
She only wanted to be with her father...
But little Mary is melting in her abyss alone...
"I'm coming, father..."
