Bears are wild animals. Although they are carnivore, most of them also consume plants and fruits. There are only eight species of bears remaining in the world, they are: Brown Bear, Polar Bear, Asian Black Bear, American Black Bear, Sun Bear, Sloth Bear, Spectacled Bear and Giant Panda. Bears are spread around the globe except for the Polar Bear which can only be found in the North Pole.
Most bears can live up to 20 years. Each species can reach different body size when they have fully grown up. Panda can grow up to 90 cm, Polar Bear can grow up to 2 m, Brown Bear can grow up to 150 cm. The largest bear such as Brown Bear can reach 600 kg in weight. With their heavy weight, they can still swim well and they are still a good runner and a good climber too. They can reach maximum speed in running at 40 km/h. They live in a cave or logs, especially during the winter for hibernation that can take up to 100 days. Even if they can stand on two feet like humans, but they are classified as caniforms (doglike carnivorans) who walked on four legs. All of their body are covered with thick skin and long fur. This is one of the reason they are being hunted by humans since prehistoric times.
Bears have sharp claws on their hand that they can use to dig or to defend themselves during a fight. Generally, bears have a huge and strong body with short tail and small ears. Male bears usually have larger body than the female. They have an excellent sense of smell that help them a lot in finding food.</a>

                                            Penguins are actually birds, but they are flightless. Their webbed feet and paddle-like wings enable them to do a fast-moving in the water. These sea birds also can stand erect and are often drawn up in long regular rows like soldiers. They walk with a dignified and stately tread that looks so comical.
Penguins are normally associated with extremely cold climates because most of their populations are found on the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost tip of Antarctica, and on sub-antarctic islands. However, a few kinds of penguins live in warmer areas near the coasts of New Zealand, South America, southern Africa, and Australia. There are also small pieces which live in tropics near the equator, mainly in Galapagos Island.
Most species of penguins have black feathers cover their back and head, and white feathers on their belly. They may also have black lines across their upper breast or white spots on their head. They are various in sizes, little pinguin may weigh 1,1 kg and grow 40 cm in height and the largest type penguin emperors may grow 114 cm in height and weighs more than 30 kg.
The penguin’s wings are short, paddle-like flippers which are totally useless for flight. Instead they are used for swimming. Penguins are excellent swimmers which are able to move fast more than 40 km per hour. Their bodies glide effortlessly through the water. When they want get out of the water, they often swim at high speeds and leap out of the water on to land or ice. Such leaps are able to carry them up as far as 1,8 m.
Penguins have short, stiff feathers. These feathers overlap and form a dense waterproof coat that maintains them dry. Some species of penguins have another layer of soft feathers to keep them in warmth and provide insulation at very cold temperatures. The blubber, a thick layer of fat, also enables them to stay warm in water.
Penguins’ diets mostly consist of seafood. They swim near the water’s surface watching for fish, squid, cuttlefish, and crustaceans such as crabs or shrimp. A penguin will dive after its prey when they spot it. A large colony of penguin may consume tons of food a day.

Bears are wild animals. Although they are carnivore, most of them also consume plants and fruits. There are only eight species of bears remaining in the world, they are: Brown Bear, Polar Bear, Asian Black Bear, American Black Bear, Sun Bear, Sloth Bear, Spectacled Bear and Giant Panda. Bears are spread around the globe except for the Polar Bear which can only be found in the North Pole.
Most bears can live up to 20 years. Each species can reach different body size when they have fully grown up. Panda can grow up to 90 cm, Polar Bear can grow up to 2 m, Brown Bear can grow up to 150 cm. The largest bear such as Brown Bear can reach 600 kg in weight. With their heavy weight, they can still swim well and they are still a good runner and a good climber too. They can reach maximum speed in running at 40 km/h. They live in a cave or logs, especially during the winter for hibernation that can take up to 100 days. Even if they can stand on two feet like humans, but they are classified as caniforms (doglike carnivorans) who walked on four legs. All of their body are covered with thick skin and long fur. This is one of the reason they are being hunted by humans since prehistoric times.
Bears have sharp claws on their hand that they can use to dig or to defend themselves during a fight. Generally, bears have a huge and strong body with short tail and small ears. Male bears usually have larger body than the female. They have an excellent sense of smell that help them a lot in finding food.</h2><br />

                            37. Penguins are actually birds, but they are flightless. Their webbed feet and paddle-like wings enable them to do a fast-moving in the water. These sea birds also can stand erect and are often drawn up in long regular rows like soldiers. They walk with a dignified and stately tread that looks so comical.
Penguins are normally associated with extremely cold climates because most of their populations are found on the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost tip of Antarctica, and on sub-antarctic islands. However, a few kinds of penguins live in warmer areas near the coasts of New Zealand, South America, southern Africa, and Australia. There are also small pieces which live in tropics near the equator, mainly in Galapagos Island.
Most species of penguins have black feathers cover their back and head, and white feathers on their belly. They may also have black lines across their upper breast or white spots on their head. They are various in sizes, little pinguin may weigh 1,1 kg and grow 40 cm in height and the largest type penguin emperors may grow 114 cm in height and weighs more than 30 kg.
The penguin’s wings are short, paddle-like flippers which are totally useless for flight. Instead they are used for swimming. Penguins are excellent swimmers which are able to move fast more than 40 km per hour. Their bodies glide effortlessly through the water. When they want get out of the water, they often swim at high speeds and leap out of the water on to land or ice. Such leaps are able to carry them up as far as 1,8 m.
Penguins have short, stiff feathers. These feathers overlap and form a dense waterproof coat that maintains them dry. Some species of penguins have another layer of soft feathers to keep them in warmth and provide insulation at very cold temperatures. The blubber, a thick layer of fat, also enables them to stay warm in water.
Penguins’ diets mostly consist of seafood. They swim near the water’s surface watching for fish, squid, cuttlefish, and crustaceans such as crabs or shrimp. A penguin will dive after its prey when they spot it. A large colony of penguin may consume tons of food a day.
