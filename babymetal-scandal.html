THE STORY OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of
this love on the very first day he laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems about
Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody who would care to listen. Such passionate
displays of love and devotion caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman.
One day, Majnun found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage, but her
father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be
proper for his daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla was promised to
another.
Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his home and family and disappeared into the
wilderness. He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending his days composing poems to
his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry another man and, although she did not love him because her heart
still belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife.
The news of this marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of solitude, refusing to
return home to his mother and father in the city.
Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed every day for his safe return home.
They would leave food for him at the bottom of the garden in the hopes that one day he would come back to
them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at
the graveside of his one true love.
‘I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla
And kiss this wall and that wall.
It’s not love of the houses that has taken my heart
but of the One who dwells in those houses.’

A MYSTERIOUS NIGHT
The door opened and Madame Bonacieux spoke to a young woman inside. D'Artagnan watched as they exchanged handkerchiefs. What does this mean ? he wondered
When Madame Bonacieux left and hurried down to street, D'artagnan ran after her. he touched her shoulder and she cried out.
"it's you !" she said. "oh, thank goodness. why you have followed me?"
"I was about to visit my friend. he lives in that house. do you knows Aramis?"
"I don," she said. i was talking to a woman."
"Who is she?"
"that is secret ," she said. "if you still want to help me, please walk with me. to my next meeting. once we arrive, you must go."
D'Artagnan did not want to leave her, especially with so many guards and secret flying above. but when they arrived at her destination, he agreed to go home. back at this apartemen, planchet told D'Artagnan that he had only been able to bring Tattoos back. but some mere guard had come and arrested him!
"they, thought he was you", Planchet said "he told me," D'Artagnan said, "I must find Monsieur de Trēvillie and tell him what has happened will you stay here? you're not afraid"
"Don't worry," Planchet said. "I can be brave when i put my mind to it."
on his way to Monsieur de Trēvillie’s mansion, D'Artagnan saw a man and woman walking together. the man wore a Musketeer's uniform. D'Artagnan thought he looked like Aramis, so he ran to them. the man turned as well. it was  Madame Bonacieux again!
"I had your promise," she said. "you swore you would follow me.”
"I'm sorry. I thought this man was someone else," D'Artagnan said.
"please take my arm, Madame," The man said.
"let us go on."
D'Artagnan was confused and wouldn't move out of their way, so the man stepped forward and pushed him aside. D'Artagnan and the man both drew their swords.
“My Lord, don't fight!” Madame Bonacieux said.
“My Lord?” D'Artagnan said. “can you possibly be------”
“It’s the Duke of Buckingham,” Madame Bonacieux said. “And now you may have ruined us all!”
“Please forgive me,” D'Artagnan said. “I only wanted protect her.”
“You are worthy young man,” said the Duke. “If you wish to help, follow us a distance. 
“If you see anyone else following us, attack them.’’
D'Artagnan followed behind Madame Bonacieux and the Duke through many dark an secret passages. Finally they reached one of the Queen’s room.
When the Queen entered, the Duke was struck by her beauty. She was twenty-six, with eyes that sparkled like emeralds. The Duke knceled at her feet.
“My Lord Duke,” the Queen said. “You must already know that I did not invite you here.”
“I know.” He said. “But I am in love with you and I wanted to see you again.”
“You must listen to me,” she said. “Our kingdoms separate us. We must never meet again. Remember, I never told you that I loved you.” 
“But you never said that you didn’t love me,” he said.
It was true that she loved him, but it was too dangerous. If the king found out, the Duke’s life would be in danger and the scandal could lead to a war with England. Just then, as if reading her thoughts, the Duke told her he wanted their kingdoms to go war.
“A war ends in peace,” he explained. “And peace requires an ambassador such as myself to come back to France and  sign the papers. Then I shall see you again and no one will be able to stop me.”
“You are a foolish man,” the Queen said. “You must go now. I don’t want see you harmed.”
“Madame, let me beg for an object from you, something to prove that I’m not dreaming,” said the Duke.
“will you leave France and return to England?” the Queen asked
“I swear it.” 
She went into her room, and returned with a small wooden jewelry box.
“My Lord, here is s gift for you to remember me by the Queen said 
The Duke fell to one knee.
“You promised to leave,” the Queen reminded him.
“I shall be true to my word, Your Highness the Duke said. “Just give me your hand, and I’ll go”
Her eyes closed, the queen offered him one hand, and leaned with the other on the table, for she felt as if she was about to faint. Passionately, the Duke pressed his lips to her fingertips, then rose and left the room.</a>

                                            There have been some efforts to battle corruption with the creation of the ombudsman and the Assets Auditing Commission (KPKPN). It has been an important agenda and part of Indonesia's official reform program since May 1998. However, the efforts made are questionable as there has been limited success to reduce corruption. Some obstacles that impeded the improvement of corruption included political and economic constraints, and the complex nature of the corruption itself.1. The pronoun it in "It has been. (par 4)" refers to .Most recently, these efforts have taken the shape of ordering corruption convicts to pay back all the money they have stolen. On 6 March 2012, the Jakarta Corruption Court sentenced Ridwan Sanjaya, an official from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, to six years in prison for rigging a tender bid for a home solar energy system project in 2009 worth IDR526 billion (US$57.86 million). Ridwan was found guilty of accepting IDR14.6 billion in kickbacks, resulting in IDR131 billionin state losses. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) stated that it will use Ridwan's verdict as material to develop the investigation on the graft scandal involving the Solar Home System project2.

Analyze the language feature of the biography recount text!Jean-Henry Dunant or Henry dunant (1828-1910) was a swiss businessman and social activist, the founder of the red cross, and the first recipient of the nobel peace price. Jean-Henry Dunant, who was born in Geneva on 8 May 1828, to a prosperous businessman named Jean)Jaques Dunant and a social activist named Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. After incomplete secondary schooling, he was apprenticed to a Geneva bank. In 1853, he travelled to Algeria to take charge of the Swiss colony of Sétif. He started construction of a wheat mill, but could not obtain the land concession that was essential for its operation. After travelling to Tunisia he returned to Geneva, where he decided to approach Napoleon III to obtain the business document he needed. At the time, the Emperor was commanding the Franco-Sardinian tr oops fighting the Austrians in northern Italy, and it was there that Henry Dunant decided to seek him out. This was how he came to be present at the end of the battle of Solferino, in Lombardy. Returning to Geneva, he wrote A Memory of Solferino , which eventually led to the creation of the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, the future International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Dunant was a member and acted as secretary. He was now famous and was received by heads of State, kings and princes of the European courts. But his financial affairs were floundering and he was declared bankrupt in 1867. Completely ruined, he was in debt for almost a million Swiss francs As a result of the scandal which this bankruptcy caused in Geneva, he resigned from his post as secretary of the International Committee. On 8 September 1867 the Committee decided to accept his resignation not only as secretary but also as a member. Dunant left for Paris, where he was reduced to sleeping on public benches. At the same time, however, the Empress Eugénie summoned him to the Tuileries Palace in order to consult him on extending the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Dunant was made an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, Holland, Sweden, Prussia and Spain. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he visited and comforted the wounded brought to Paris and introduced the wearing of a badge so that the dead could be identified. When peace returned, Dunant traveled to London, where he endeavored to organize a diplomatic conference on the problem of prisoners of war; the Tsar encouraged him but England was hostile to the plan. An international congress for the " complete and final abolition of the traffic in Negroes and the slave trade " opened in London on 1 February 1875, on Dunant's initiative. There followed years of wandering and utter poverty for Dunant: he traveled on foot in Alsace, Germany and Italy, living on charity and the hospitality of a few friends. Finally, in 1887, he ended up in the Swiss village of Heiden, overlooking Lake Constance, where he fell ill. He found refuge in the local hospice, and it was there that he was discovered in 1895 by a journalist, Georg Baumberger, who wrote an article about him which, within a few days, was reprinted in the press throughout Europe. Messages of sympathy reached Dunant from all over the world; overnight he was once more famous and honoured. In 1901, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Henry Dunant died on 30 October 1910. The date of his birth, 8 May, is celebrated as World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day.</a>

Former Czechoslovakia president, Václav Havel, who has a good image amang his people, showed that politics is the will to make people happy. However, politicians nowadays only full of energy when they talk about power, particularly when the issue brings benefits to them. One scandal occurs and another follows, either by the same or different actors. Recently, for example, several newspapers reveal the evidence that many candidates for the provincial legislative bodies have falsified their academic degrees.

THE STORY OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of
this love on the very first day he laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems about
Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody who would care to listen. Such passionate
displays of love and devotion caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman.
One day, Majnun found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage, but her
father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be
proper for his daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla was promised to
another.
Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his home and family and disappeared into the
wilderness. He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending his days composing poems to
his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry another man and, although she did not love him because her heart
still belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife.
The news of this marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of solitude, refusing to
return home to his mother and father in the city.
Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed every day for his safe return home.
They would leave food for him at the bottom of the garden in the hopes that one day he would come back to
them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at
the graveside of his one true love.
‘I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla
And kiss this wall and that wall.
It’s not love of the houses that has taken my heart
but of the One who dwells in those houses.’

THE STORY OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of
this love on the very first day he laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems about
Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody who would care to listen. Such passionate
displays of love and devotion caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman.
One day, Majnun found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage, but her
father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be
proper for his daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla was promised to
another.
Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his home and family and disappeared into the
wilderness. He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending his days composing poems to
his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry another man and, although she did not love him because her heart
still belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife.
The news of this marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of solitude, refusing to
return home to his mother and father in the city.
Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed every day for his safe return home.
They would leave food for him at the bottom of the garden in the hopes that one day he would come back to
them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at
the graveside of his one true love.
‘I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla
And kiss this wall and that wall.
It’s not love of the houses that has taken my heart
but of the One who dwells in those houses.’
29. . … until he too surrendered to the impossible
grief (Last paragraph). The underlined word is
in contrast with …
a. cheer
b. sorrow
c. endurance
d. persistence
e. motivation</a>

I wish the following paragraphs would chronicle years of parental neglect or some sort of rare neuromuscular disorder that prevented me from pedalling, but I have no one to blame but myself. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I just can’t.
My childhood progressed like any other. Tricycles, training wheels – no problem. But the two-wheeled version proved troublesome. I would start moving just fine, but then, with the agility of a drunken trapeze artist, I would tilt, panic and put my feet down as the pedals continued rotating and slapped me in back of the legs.
It was no big deal at first. All my friends were learning, too. It’s a rite of passage. But for me this particular rite never quite seemed to pass. And when my brother – three years younger than me – started riding with all the zest of Pee-wee Herman, I realized there was a problem.
My first instinct was to hide my failure so that my friends would never know. I became a damn good rollerblader and I had a believable set of excuses on hand in the event I was ever asked to go mountain biking. I even brainwashed myself into believing in the virtues of not riding a bike. Pumping the tires, greasing the chain, locking it up everywhere you went, it all seemed like a hassle to me. And who looks good in a helmet?
But there would be one quiet Sunday every summer when I would walk my bike over to the schoolyard in secrecy, hop on, tip over and hop off, my scratched calves a strong enough deterrent until next year.
My parents took it hard. Is there a bigger mark of a failed fatherhood than a son who cannot ride a bike? At least I could throw a baseball (horribly). After years of walking alongside me, holding the back of my seat, they took drastic measures. While we were on vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y., they sought out the services of a cycling sage whose job it was to teach people to ride bikes. After three mosquito-bitten hours in the woods, he began to question his career.
Once I entered high school, my Schwinn-less abilities were largely forgotten. High school was all about showing up late, looking bored and shuffling through the halls at an irritatingly casual pace. It was, literally, the anti-bike society. I was proud to be a non-biker, shunning the punctuality, shorts and cardiovascular health that came with it. I had one friend who wanted to be a bike courier. He was largely ostracized.
I did try once more in Grade 10 after confessing my secret to a girl in a last-ditch attempt to embark on a sexual Tour de France. After an hour of calf-scratched mockery and a short trip to second base, I pulled out of the race and never opened my mouth again.
The Lance Armstrong scandal reinforced my reluctance in adulthood: I’d had a bad feeling about him from the beginning. In fact I didn’t push a pedal for the next 10 years.
I may have forgotten, but my mother never did. One hot, unsuspecting July afternoon, she couldn’t take it any more. She grabbed me, gave me her bike and sent me to the schoolyard, telling me not to leave until I’d learned.
After a bit of scrupulous surveillance to make sure no one was in sight, I climbed aboard the beast – a women’s bike that was three sizes too small. I launched into strategic warfare with my childhood and my decade-dormant equilibrium. Should I pedal first? Push and then pedal? Did I still have the training wheels in the garage?
After an hour and a half of scratched calves, internal tantrums and the threat of testicular atrophy from the female crossbar, I finally started to go. Five seconds at first, then I panicked and tipped over, but I turned around and started again. Ten seconds, 20 seconds and then a full minute without kissing pavement. I felt a rush of fresh new air in my lungs, a breath that was a little more complete. I am sure my cries of “Hey! Hey! Look at this!” drew more than a few neighbours to their windows to see an overgrown man’s low-budget re-enactment of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.
Did this newfound skill start a renaissance of childlike wonder and being? Absolutely not. In fact, I still absolutely suck. I have difficulty steering, and mastering the brakes might take me another 25 years.
But I did learn one thing: Your successes don’t define you, your failures do. Embrace your failures – they keep you going. If we only had successes we’d have nothing to live for. And if you can’t quite crack the code, put it down, but never walk away, even if it takes you 10 years. It’s just like riding a bike.</a>

                                            Headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, France, the automotive manufacturer Renault was established 120 years ago in 1899, and Japanese automotive manufacturer, Nissan, was founded in 1933, headquartered in Yokohama, Japan. In 1999, these two automotive giants entered into the Renault-Nissan strategic alliance and, in 2016, Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Motors was added to the mix. In 2019, the alliance found itself at a crossroads following an ethics scandal that has rocked the group. And it is Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman and CEO of Renault, who is at the heart of this controversy. Together with top executives at Nissan and Mitsubishi, the alliance has been embroiled in an ethical scandal that regularly made headlines throughout 2018 and 2019. Ghosn was arrested in late 2018 on charges with financial misconduct and breach of trust, following which he was ousted by both Nissan and Renault. Nissan and Mitsubishi claim that Ghosn improperly received $9 million as compensation, while Renault claims that Ghosn’s expenses amounting to €11 million are suspicious. Following a private investigation into the scandal, Renault issued a statement that said “questionable and concealed practices and violations of the group’s ethical principles, particularly concerning relationships with third parties, management of conflicts of interest, and protection of corporate assets.” One of the biggest accusations revolves around the payments made to an Omani distributor. It is alleged that $32 million of Nissan’s money has been paid to the distributor, some of which is believed to have been used to purchase a luxury boat for Ghosn and his family. Nissan has stated publicly that “aside from any criminal matters, Nissan’s internal investigation has uncovered substantial evidence of blatantly unethical conduct.” This alleged misconduct while at the feet of Ghosn is not limited to him alone. Gregory Raymond Kelly has also been named in the accusations. An internal investigation by Nissan found that Ghosn and Kelly had been underreporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities reports in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Ghosn’s compensation and that there had been personal use of company assets. Unfortunately, while such scandals are not isolated to Japan, the corporate culture within Japanese companies to said to allow such issues to go untouched, at least for some time. It is expected that employees, even those who are at a senior level, respect the strict hierarchies present in Japanese society. Employees are expected to avoid conflict with their seniors, and to avoid sowing discontent, rather than exercising their vigilance and practicing corporate oversight. Meanwhile, Ghosn fervently denies any wrongdoing and has said that he is a casualty of a plot carried out by fellow executives at Nissan over fears that Ghosn was planning to turn the company into a subsidiary of its longstanding partner, Renault, and that executives were also trying to draw attention away from years of bad results. What is arguably the most concerning factor is that such a scandal could ever come to fruition and reach the point that it has, the enormity of the financial misconduct and ethical violations means that the unethical activities have been underway for a while. The alliance should now focus on analyzing and addressing the weaknesses in its corporate governance that have allowed such misconduct to happen. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 6-16. Are you surprised that in such large and well-known organizations like Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi such a scandal could happen? How do you think this could happen?​</a>

                                            Facebook apologizes after data breachFacebook boss Mark Zuckerberg apologized for the data breach that was revealed last week. Mr Zuckerberg took out full-page advertisements in broadsheet newspapers in the UK and US to make his apology for the data privacy scandal. Zuckerberg was being criticized for being too slow to respond to the news. Personal data on up to 50 million users was used by a U.S. political consultancy called Cambridge Analytica. This company is accused of using the leaked data to benefit Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Zuckerberg said: "This was a breach of trust, and I am sorry.... We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again." The apology made no mention of Cambridge Analytica.Mr Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook could and should have done more to protect user data and to stop it being exploited. Reports are now circulating that Facebook was warned its data protection was too weak back in 2011. Mr Zuckerberg outlined the actions Facebook would take going forward. He said: "We're investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected." The value of Facebook has fallen by $75 billion this week; Zuckerberg's wealth fell by $10 billion. There has also been a surge in users abandoning their Facebook pages, in online calls to #deletefacebook.Provide SHORT and SIMPLE Answers to the following questions.1.

THE STORY OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of
this love on the very first day he laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems about
Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody who would care to listen. Such passionate
displays of love and devotion caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman.
One day, Majnun found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage, but her
father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be
proper for his daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla was promised to
another.
Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his home and family and disappeared into the
wilderness. He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending his days composing poems to
his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry another man and, although she did not love him because her heart
still belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife.
The news of this marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of solitude, refusing to
return home to his mother and father in the city.
Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed every day for his safe return home.
They would leave food for him at the bottom of the garden in the hopes that one day he would come back to
them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at
the graveside of his one true love.
‘I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla
And kiss this wall and that wall.
It’s not love of the houses that has taken my heart
but of the One who dwells in those houses.’

A MYSTERIOUS NIGHT
The door opened and Madame Bonacieux spoke to a young woman inside. D'Artagnan watched as they exchanged handkerchiefs. What does this mean ? he wondered
When Madame Bonacieux left and hurried down to street, D'artagnan ran after her. he touched her shoulder and she cried out.
"it's you !" she said. "oh, thank goodness. why you have followed me?"
"I was about to visit my friend. he lives in that house. do you knows Aramis?"
"I don," she said. i was talking to a woman."
"Who is she?"
"that is secret ," she said. "if you still want to help me, please walk with me. to my next meeting. once we arrive, you must go."
D'Artagnan did not want to leave her, especially with so many guards and secret flying above. but when they arrived at her destination, he agreed to go home. back at this apartemen, planchet told D'Artagnan that he had only been able to bring Tattoos back. but some mere guard had come and arrested him!
"they, thought he was you", Planchet said "he told me," D'Artagnan said, "I must find Monsieur de Trēvillie and tell him what has happened will you stay here? you're not afraid"
"Don't worry," Planchet said. "I can be brave when i put my mind to it."
on his way to Monsieur de Trēvillie’s mansion, D'Artagnan saw a man and woman walking together. the man wore a Musketeer's uniform. D'Artagnan thought he looked like Aramis, so he ran to them. the man turned as well. it was  Madame Bonacieux again!
"I had your promise," she said. "you swore you would follow me.”
"I'm sorry. I thought this man was someone else," D'Artagnan said.
"please take my arm, Madame," The man said.
"let us go on."
D'Artagnan was confused and wouldn't move out of their way, so the man stepped forward and pushed him aside. D'Artagnan and the man both drew their swords.
“My Lord, don't fight!” Madame Bonacieux said.
“My Lord?” D'Artagnan said. “can you possibly be------”
“It’s the Duke of Buckingham,” Madame Bonacieux said. “And now you may have ruined us all!”
“Please forgive me,” D'Artagnan said. “I only wanted protect her.”
“You are worthy young man,” said the Duke. “If you wish to help, follow us a distance. 
“If you see anyone else following us, attack them.’’
D'Artagnan followed behind Madame Bonacieux and the Duke through many dark an secret passages. Finally they reached one of the Queen’s room.
When the Queen entered, the Duke was struck by her beauty. She was twenty-six, with eyes that sparkled like emeralds. The Duke knceled at her feet.
“My Lord Duke,” the Queen said. “You must already know that I did not invite you here.”
“I know.” He said. “But I am in love with you and I wanted to see you again.”
“You must listen to me,” she said. “Our kingdoms separate us. We must never meet again. Remember, I never told you that I loved you.” 
“But you never said that you didn’t love me,” he said.
It was true that she loved him, but it was too dangerous. If the king found out, the Duke’s life would be in danger and the scandal could lead to a war with England. Just then, as if reading her thoughts, the Duke told her he wanted their kingdoms to go war.
“A war ends in peace,” he explained. “And peace requires an ambassador such as myself to come back to France and  sign the papers. Then I shall see you again and no one will be able to stop me.”
“You are a foolish man,” the Queen said. “You must go now. I don’t want see you harmed.”
“Madame, let me beg for an object from you, something to prove that I’m not dreaming,” said the Duke.
“will you leave France and return to England?” the Queen asked
“I swear it.” 
She went into her room, and returned with a small wooden jewelry box.
“My Lord, here is s gift for you to remember me by the Queen said 
The Duke fell to one knee.
“You promised to leave,” the Queen reminded him.
“I shall be true to my word, Your Highness the Duke said. “Just give me your hand, and I’ll go”
Her eyes closed, the queen offered him one hand, and leaned with the other on the table, for she felt as if she was about to faint. Passionately, the Duke pressed his lips to her fingertips, then rose and left the room.</h2><br />

                            11. There have been some efforts to battle corruption with the creation of the ombudsman and the Assets Auditing Commission (KPKPN). It has been an important agenda and part of Indonesia's official reform program since May 1998. However, the efforts made are questionable as there has been limited success to reduce corruption. Some obstacles that impeded the improvement of corruption included political and economic constraints, and the complex nature of the corruption itself.1. The pronoun it in "It has been. (par 4)" refers to .Most recently, these efforts have taken the shape of ordering corruption convicts to pay back all the money they have stolen. On 6 March 2012, the Jakarta Corruption Court sentenced Ridwan Sanjaya, an official from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, to six years in prison for rigging a tender bid for a home solar energy system project in 2009 worth IDR526 billion (US$57.86 million). Ridwan was found guilty of accepting IDR14.6 billion in kickbacks, resulting in IDR131 billionin state losses. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) stated that it will use Ridwan's verdict as material to develop the investigation on the graft scandal involving the Solar Home System project2.

Analyze the language feature of the biography recount text!Jean-Henry Dunant or Henry dunant (1828-1910) was a swiss businessman and social activist, the founder of the red cross, and the first recipient of the nobel peace price. Jean-Henry Dunant, who was born in Geneva on 8 May 1828, to a prosperous businessman named Jean)Jaques Dunant and a social activist named Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. After incomplete secondary schooling, he was apprenticed to a Geneva bank. In 1853, he travelled to Algeria to take charge of the Swiss colony of Sétif. He started construction of a wheat mill, but could not obtain the land concession that was essential for its operation. After travelling to Tunisia he returned to Geneva, where he decided to approach Napoleon III to obtain the business document he needed. At the time, the Emperor was commanding the Franco-Sardinian tr oops fighting the Austrians in northern Italy, and it was there that Henry Dunant decided to seek him out. This was how he came to be present at the end of the battle of Solferino, in Lombardy. Returning to Geneva, he wrote A Memory of Solferino , which eventually led to the creation of the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, the future International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Dunant was a member and acted as secretary. He was now famous and was received by heads of State, kings and princes of the European courts. But his financial affairs were floundering and he was declared bankrupt in 1867. Completely ruined, he was in debt for almost a million Swiss francs As a result of the scandal which this bankruptcy caused in Geneva, he resigned from his post as secretary of the International Committee. On 8 September 1867 the Committee decided to accept his resignation not only as secretary but also as a member. Dunant left for Paris, where he was reduced to sleeping on public benches. At the same time, however, the Empress Eugénie summoned him to the Tuileries Palace in order to consult him on extending the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Dunant was made an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, Holland, Sweden, Prussia and Spain. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he visited and comforted the wounded brought to Paris and introduced the wearing of a badge so that the dead could be identified. When peace returned, Dunant traveled to London, where he endeavored to organize a diplomatic conference on the problem of prisoners of war; the Tsar encouraged him but England was hostile to the plan. An international congress for the " complete and final abolition of the traffic in Negroes and the slave trade " opened in London on 1 February 1875, on Dunant's initiative. There followed years of wandering and utter poverty for Dunant: he traveled on foot in Alsace, Germany and Italy, living on charity and the hospitality of a few friends. Finally, in 1887, he ended up in the Swiss village of Heiden, overlooking Lake Constance, where he fell ill. He found refuge in the local hospice, and it was there that he was discovered in 1895 by a journalist, Georg Baumberger, who wrote an article about him which, within a few days, was reprinted in the press throughout Europe. Messages of sympathy reached Dunant from all over the world; overnight he was once more famous and honoured. In 1901, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Henry Dunant died on 30 October 1910. The date of his birth, 8 May, is celebrated as World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day.</h2><br />

Analisis fitur bahasa dari teks penghitungan ulang biografi!</p><p>Jean-Henry Dunant atau Henry dunant (1828-1910) adalah seorang pengusaha swiss dan aktivis sosial, pendiri palang merah, dan penerima pertama dari harga nobel perdamaian. Jean-Henry Dunant, yang lahir di Jenewa pada tanggal 8 Mei 1828, dari seorang pengusaha makmur bernama Jean) Jaques Dunant dan seorang aktivis sosial bernama Antoinette Dunant-Colladon. Setelah tamat sekolah menengah, dia magang di bank Jenewa. Pada tahun 1853, dia pergi ke Aljazair untuk memimpin koloni Swiss di Sétif. Dia memulai pembangunan pabrik gandum, tetapi tidak dapat memperoleh konsesi lahan yang penting untuk operasinya. Setelah melakukan perjalanan ke Tunisia, ia kembali ke Jenewa, di mana ia memutuskan untuk mendekati Napoleon III untuk mendapatkan dokumen bisnis yang ia butuhkan. Pada saat itu, Kaisar sedang memerintahkan pasukan Perancis-Sardinia melawan Austria di Italia utara, dan di sanalah Henry Dunant memutuskan untuk mencarinya. Begitulah cara dia hadir di akhir pertempuran Solferino, di Lombardy. Kembali ke Jenewa, ia menulis A Memory of Solferino, yang akhirnya mengarah pada pembentukan Komite Internasional untuk Bantuan bagi yang Terluka, Komite Internasional Palang Merah (ICRC) di masa depan. Dunant adalah anggota dan bertindak sebagai sekretaris. Dia sekarang terkenal dan diterima oleh kepala negara, raja dan pangeran dari pengadilan Eropa. Tetapi urusan keuangannya kacau dan dia dinyatakan bangkrut pada tahun 1867. Rusak total, dia berhutang hampir satu juta franc Swiss Sebagai akibat dari skandal yang diakibatkan oleh kebangkrutan ini di Jenewa, dia mengundurkan diri dari jabatannya sebagai sekretaris Internasional. Komite. Pada tanggal 8 September 1867 Komite memutuskan untuk menerima pengunduran dirinya tidak hanya sebagai sekretaris tetapi juga sebagai anggota. Dunant berangkat ke Paris, di mana dia terpaksa tidur di bangku umum. Namun, pada saat yang sama, Permaisuri Eugénie memanggilnya ke Istana Tuileries untuk berkonsultasi dengannya tentang perpanjangan Konvensi Jenewa untuk perang laut. Dunant diangkat menjadi anggota kehormatan dari masyarakat Palang Merah nasional Austria, Belanda,Swedia, Prusia dan Spanyol. Selama Perang Perancis-Prusia tahun 1870, ia mengunjungi dan menghibur korban luka yang dibawa ke Paris dan memperkenalkan penggunaan lencana sehingga orang mati dapat diidentifikasi. Ketika perdamaian kembali, Dunant pergi ke London, di mana dia berusaha untuk menyelenggarakan konferensi diplomatik tentang masalah tawanan perang; Tsar mendorongnya tetapi Inggris menentang rencana tersebut. Sebuah kongres internasional untuk "penghapusan total dan terakhir lalu lintas di Negro dan perdagangan budak" dibuka di London pada tanggal 1 Februari 1875, atas inisiatif Dunant. Di sana diikuti tahun-tahun pengembaraan dan kemiskinan total untuk Dunant: dia melakukan perjalanan dengan berjalan kaki di Alsace, Jerman dan Italia, hidup dengan amal dan keramahtamahan dari beberapa teman. Akhirnya, pada tahun 1887, dia berakhir di desa Heiden di Swiss, menghadap Danau Constance, di mana dia jatuh sakit. Dia menemukan perlindungan di rumah sakit lokal, dan di sanalah dia ditemukan pada tahun 1895 oleh seorang jurnalis, Georg Baumberger, yang menulis artikel tentang dia yang, dalam beberapa hari, dicetak ulang di pers di seluruh Eropa. Pesan simpati mencapai Dunant dari seluruh dunia; dalam semalam dia sekali lagi terkenal dan dihormati. Pada tahun 1901, ia menerima Hadiah Nobel Perdamaian. Henry Dunant meninggal pada 30 Oktober 1910. Tanggal lahirnya, 8 Mei, diperingati sebagai Hari Palang Merah dan Bulan Sabit Merah Sedunia.</p><br />

THE STORY OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of
this love on the very first day he laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems about
Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody who would care to listen. Such passionate
displays of love and devotion caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman.
One day, Majnun found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage, but her
father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be
proper for his daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla was promised to
another.
Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his home and family and disappeared into the
wilderness. He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending his days composing poems to
his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry another man and, although she did not love him because her heart
still belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife.
The news of this marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of solitude, refusing to
return home to his mother and father in the city.
Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed every day for his safe return home.
They would leave food for him at the bottom of the garden in the hopes that one day he would come back to
them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at
the graveside of his one true love.
‘I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla
And kiss this wall and that wall.
It’s not love of the houses that has taken my heart
but of the One who dwells in those houses.’

THE STORY OF LAYLA AND MAJNUN
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah was just a boy when he fell deeply in love with Layla Al-Aamiriya. He was sure of
this love on the very first day he laid eyes upon her at school. He soon began to write beautiful love poems about
Layla and he would read them out loud on street corners to anybody who would care to listen. Such passionate
displays of love and devotion caused many to refer to the boy as Majnun, meaning madman.
One day, Majnun found the courage to ask Layla’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage, but her
father refused the request. Such a marriage, the father reasoned, would only cause a scandal. It would not be
proper for his daughter to marry a person whom everybody called 'madman'. Instead, Layla was promised to
another.
Majnun was overcome with grief and abandoned his home and family and disappeared into the
wilderness. He lived a miserable life of solitude among the wild animals, spending his days composing poems to
his beloved Layla. Layla was forced to marry another man and, although she did not love him because her heart
still belonged to Majnun, she remained a faithful wife.
The news of this marriage was devastating to Majnun who continued to live a life of solitude, refusing to
return home to his mother and father in the city.
Majnun’s mother and father missed their son terribly and longed every day for his safe return home.
They would leave food for him at the bottom of the garden in the hopes that one day he would come back to
them out of the desert. But Majnun remained in the wilderness, writing his poetry in solitude, never speaking to
a single soul.
Majnun spent all of his time alone, surrounded only by the animals of the wilderness that gathered
around him and protected him during the long desert nights. He was often seen by travellers who would pass
him on their way towards the city. The travellers said that Majnun spent his days reciting poetry to himself and
writing in the sand with a long stick; they said that he truly was driven to madness with a broken heart.
Many years later, Majnun’s father and mother both passed away. Knowing of his devotion to his parents,
Layla was determined to send Majnun word of their passing. Eventually she found an old man who claimed to
5
have seen Majnun in the desert. After much begging and pleading the old man agreed to pass on a message the
next time he set off on his travels.
One day, the old man crossed paths with Majnun in the desert. There he solemnly delivered the news
concerning the death of Majnun’s parents and was forced to witness what a terrible blow this was to the young
poet.
Overcome with regret and loss, Majnun cut himself off from the world entirely and vowed to live in the
desert until his own death.
Some years later, Layla’s husband died. The young woman hoped that finally she would be with her one
true love; that finally she and Majnun would be together forever. But sadly, this was not to be. Tradition
demanded that Layla remain in her home alone to grieve for her dead husband for two whole years without
seeing another soul. The thought of not being with Majnun for two more years was more than Layla could bear.
They had been separated for a lifetime and two more years of solitude, two more years without seeing her
beloved, was enough to cause the young woman to give up on life. Layla died of a broken heart, alone in her
home without ever seeing Majnun again.
News of Layla’s death reached Majnun in the wilderness. He immediately travelled to the place where
Layla had been buried and there he wept and wept until he too surrendered to the impossible grief and died at

I wish the following paragraphs would chronicle years of parental neglect or some sort of rare neuromuscular disorder that prevented me from pedalling, but I have no one to blame but myself. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I just can’t.
My childhood progressed like any other. Tricycles, training wheels – no problem. But the two-wheeled version proved troublesome. I would start moving just fine, but then, with the agility of a drunken trapeze artist, I would tilt, panic and put my feet down as the pedals continued rotating and slapped me in back of the legs.
It was no big deal at first. All my friends were learning, too. It’s a rite of passage. But for me this particular rite never quite seemed to pass. And when my brother – three years younger than me – started riding with all the zest of Pee-wee Herman, I realized there was a problem.
My first instinct was to hide my failure so that my friends would never know. I became a damn good rollerblader and I had a believable set of excuses on hand in the event I was ever asked to go mountain biking. I even brainwashed myself into believing in the virtues of not riding a bike. Pumping the tires, greasing the chain, locking it up everywhere you went, it all seemed like a hassle to me. And who looks good in a helmet?
But there would be one quiet Sunday every summer when I would walk my bike over to the schoolyard in secrecy, hop on, tip over and hop off, my scratched calves a strong enough deterrent until next year.
My parents took it hard. Is there a bigger mark of a failed fatherhood than a son who cannot ride a bike? At least I could throw a baseball (horribly). After years of walking alongside me, holding the back of my seat, they took drastic measures. While we were on vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y., they sought out the services of a cycling sage whose job it was to teach people to ride bikes. After three mosquito-bitten hours in the woods, he began to question his career.
Once I entered high school, my Schwinn-less abilities were largely forgotten. High school was all about showing up late, looking bored and shuffling through the halls at an irritatingly casual pace. It was, literally, the anti-bike society. I was proud to be a non-biker, shunning the punctuality, shorts and cardiovascular health that came with it. I had one friend who wanted to be a bike courier. He was largely ostracized.
I did try once more in Grade 10 after confessing my secret to a girl in a last-ditch attempt to embark on a sexual Tour de France. After an hour of calf-scratched mockery and a short trip to second base, I pulled out of the race and never opened my mouth again.
The Lance Armstrong scandal reinforced my reluctance in adulthood: I’d had a bad feeling about him from the beginning. In fact I didn’t push a pedal for the next 10 years.
I may have forgotten, but my mother never did. One hot, unsuspecting July afternoon, she couldn’t take it any more. She grabbed me, gave me her bike and sent me to the schoolyard, telling me not to leave until I’d learned.
After a bit of scrupulous surveillance to make sure no one was in sight, I climbed aboard the beast – a women’s bike that was three sizes too small. I launched into strategic warfare with my childhood and my decade-dormant equilibrium. Should I pedal first? Push and then pedal? Did I still have the training wheels in the garage?
After an hour and a half of scratched calves, internal tantrums and the threat of testicular atrophy from the female crossbar, I finally started to go. Five seconds at first, then I panicked and tipped over, but I turned around and started again. Ten seconds, 20 seconds and then a full minute without kissing pavement. I felt a rush of fresh new air in my lungs, a breath that was a little more complete. I am sure my cries of “Hey! Hey! Look at this!” drew more than a few neighbours to their windows to see an overgrown man’s low-budget re-enactment of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.
Did this newfound skill start a renaissance of childlike wonder and being? Absolutely not. In fact, I still absolutely suck. I have difficulty steering, and mastering the brakes might take me another 25 years.
But I did learn one thing: Your successes don’t define you, your failures do. Embrace your failures – they keep you going. If we only had successes we’d have nothing to live for. And if you can’t quite crack the code, put it down, but never walk away, even if it takes you 10 years. It’s just like riding a bike.</h2><br />

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="headquartered-in-boulogne-billancourt-france-the-automotive-manufacturer-renault-was-established-120-years-ago-in-1899-and-japanese-automotive-manufacturer-nissan-was-founded-in-1933-headquarter">
                            27. Headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, France, the automotive manufacturer Renault was established 120 years ago in 1899, and Japanese automotive manufacturer, Nissan, was founded in 1933, headquartered in Yokohama, Japan. In 1999, these two automotive giants entered into the Renault-Nissan strategic alliance and, in 2016, Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Motors was added to the mix. In 2019, the alliance found itself at a crossroads following an ethics scandal that has rocked the group. And it is Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman and CEO of Renault, who is at the heart of this controversy. Together with top executives at Nissan and Mitsubishi, the alliance has been embroiled in an ethical scandal that regularly made headlines throughout 2018 and 2019. Ghosn was arrested in late 2018 on charges with financial misconduct and breach of trust, following which he was ousted by both Nissan and Renault. Nissan and Mitsubishi claim that Ghosn improperly received $9 million as compensation, while Renault claims that Ghosn’s expenses amounting to €11 million are suspicious. Following a private investigation into the scandal, Renault issued a statement that said “questionable and concealed practices and violations of the group’s ethical principles, particularly concerning relationships with third parties, management of conflicts of interest, and protection of corporate assets.” One of the biggest accusations revolves around the payments made to an Omani distributor. It is alleged that $32 million of Nissan’s money has been paid to the distributor, some of which is believed to have been used to purchase a luxury boat for Ghosn and his family. Nissan has stated publicly that “aside from any criminal matters, Nissan’s internal investigation has uncovered substantial evidence of blatantly unethical conduct.” This alleged misconduct while at the feet of Ghosn is not limited to him alone. Gregory Raymond Kelly has also been named in the accusations. An internal investigation by Nissan found that Ghosn and Kelly had been underreporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities reports in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Ghosn’s compensation and that there had been personal use of company assets. Unfortunately, while such scandals are not isolated to Japan, the corporate culture within Japanese companies to said to allow such issues to go untouched, at least for some time. It is expected that employees, even those who are at a senior level, respect the strict hierarchies present in Japanese society. Employees are expected to avoid conflict with their seniors, and to avoid sowing discontent, rather than exercising their vigilance and practicing corporate oversight. Meanwhile, Ghosn fervently denies any wrongdoing and has said that he is a casualty of a plot carried out by fellow executives at Nissan over fears that Ghosn was planning to turn the company into a subsidiary of its longstanding partner, Renault, and that executives were also trying to draw attention away from years of bad results. What is arguably the most concerning factor is that such a scandal could ever come to fruition and reach the point that it has, the enormity of the financial misconduct and ethical violations means that the unethical activities have been underway for a while. The alliance should now focus on analyzing and addressing the weaknesses in its corporate governance that have allowed such misconduct to happen. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 6-16. Are you surprised that in such large and well-known organizations like Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi such a scandal could happen? How do you think this could happen?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>It can be surprising that a scandal of such magnitude could occur in large and well-known organizations like Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi. Several factors could contribute to this:</p><p></p><p>1. Complex corporate Structures: These multinational corporations often have complex organizational structures, which can make it challenging to detect misconduct, especially when it involves high-ranking executives.</p><p></p><p>2. Lack of Oversight: Sometimes, there might be a lack of effective oversight mechanisms in place, allowing unethical practices to go unnoticed. This can happen due to a culture of deference to senior executives or inadequate internal controls.</p><p></p><p>3. Cultural Factors: Corporate cultures in different countries can vary significantly. In Japan, for example, there may be cultural factors at play, such as a reluctance to confront superiors or a focus on preserving harmony, which could delay or hinder the detection of misconduct.</p><p></p><p>4. Pressure for Results: There may be immense pressure within these organizations to achieve financial results and maintain growth. This pressure can sometimes lead to unethical behavior as individuals or teams attempt to meet targets at any cost.</p><p></p><p>5. Complex Business Relationships: In the case of alliances like Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, complex business relationships and dependencies can create opportunities for unethical practices, such as funneling money through distributors.</p><p></p><p>6. Lack of Whistleblower Protection: Employees may fear retaliation or lack proper channels for reporting misconduct. This can deter them from speaking up about unethical behavior they observe.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Overall, a combination of these factors, along with the complexities of running large multinational corporations, can create an environment where unethical behavior goes undetected or unaddressed for an extended period. It underscores the importance of strong corporate governance, effective internal controls, and a culture that encourages transparency and ethical conduct to prevent such scandals.</p><p></p>Hope it helps, please mark it as the brainliest answer^^!! :)<br />

                            34. Facebook apologizes after data breachFacebook boss Mark Zuckerberg apologized for the data breach that was revealed last week. Mr Zuckerberg took out full-page advertisements in broadsheet newspapers in the UK and US to make his apology for the data privacy scandal. Zuckerberg was being criticized for being too slow to respond to the news. Personal data on up to 50 million users was used by a U.S. political consultancy called Cambridge Analytica. This company is accused of using the leaked data to benefit Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Zuckerberg said: "This was a breach of trust, and I am sorry.... We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again." The apology made no mention of Cambridge Analytica.Mr Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook could and should have done more to protect user data and to stop it being exploited. Reports are now circulating that Facebook was warned its data protection was too weak back in 2011. Mr Zuckerberg outlined the actions Facebook would take going forward. He said: "We're investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected." The value of Facebook has fallen by $75 billion this week; Zuckerberg's wealth fell by $10 billion. There has also been a surge in users abandoning their Facebook pages, in online calls to #deletefacebook.Provide SHORT and SIMPLE Answers to the following questions.1.	What kind of newspapers did Facebook puts ads in to apologize? 2.	What is Mark Zuckerberg being criticized for? 3.	How many users may have had their data exploited? 4.	What kind of company is Cambridge Analytica? 5.	What is Facebook taking to ensure there is not another data breach? 6.	What could and should Facebook have done to protect data? 7.	When was Facebook warned about its weak data protection? 8.	What is Facebook now investigating? 9.	How much less is Mark Zuckerberg worth since the scandal began? 10.	What is the hashtag that is encouraging users to close their page? ​</h2><br />
