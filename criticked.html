                                            In the 1890s, bicycles became quite popular in the United States as the
new "safety" bicycles replaced the older penny-farthing bicycles. On the
penny-farthing bicycles, one wheel was much larger than the other, and these bicycles were not very stable; they were always falling over. On the new "safety" bicycles, both wheels were equal in size, and they were much easier to control.
Many women also enjoyed these new "safety" bicycles, but they had to take measures to deal with their clothing while riding the bicycles. The fashion at the time was for long, full skirts that did not go well with bicycles. Some women put lead weights in their skirts to keep their skirts from blowing up. Other women changed from long skirts to bloomers, which were long, full, wide pants, but some people felt that bloomers were inappropriate for women to wear; in fact, some newspaper and magazines of the day criticized the new bicycles fashion as a danger to ladies' morals.

Public defender Azas Tigor Nainggolan criticized the social punishment handed to COVID-19 health protocol violators - which involves placing a person inside a coffin - amidst the transitional period of social restriction shows the Jakarta Administration’s lack of seriousness in imposing punishments. “There is no such thing legal wise. That is being out of control. Placing a person inside a coffin seems like a buffoonery and gives the impression that the city administration is not serious in enforcing the law,” said Tigor to Tempo on Friday, September 4. The Jakarta Residents Forum (Fakta) coordinator also argued that the unclear handling of violators is rooted in ambiguous regulations. Tigor added that it reflects how city officials fail to understand the behavior of its own residents during a social restriction, including the sanction mechanism and supervisory. He also questioned the 'coffin punishment' from a health standpoint as the coffin that is used is shared among other violators. In principle, Tigor believes punishments must act as a deterrent and that the important aspect is to be consistent in implementing it. ​</a>

                                            In the 1890s, bicycles became quite popular in the united states as the new "safety" bicycles replaced the older penny-farthing bicycles. On the penny-farthing bicycles, one wheel was much larger than the other, and these bicycles were not very stable; they were always falling over. On the new "safety" bicycles, both wheels were equal in size, and they were much easier to control. Many women also enjoyed these new "safety" bicycles, but they had to take measures to deal with their clothing while riding the bicycles. The fashion at the time was for long, full skirts that did not go well with bicycles. Some women put lead weights in their skirts to keep their skirts from blowing up. Other women changed from long skirts to bloomers, which were long, full, wide pants, but some people felt that bloomers were inappropriate for women to wear; in fact, some newspaper and magazines of the day criticized the new bicycles fashion as a danger to ladies’ morals</a>

                                            Tugas 2 Bahasa dan Terminologi Hukum   Dear students,  Here below is the reading intended for you to do your best in quick reading. Try to read and answer the questions quickly and let me know honestly how fast you had made.  A distinctively American architecture began with Frank Lloyd Wright, who had taken to heart the admonition that form should follow function and who thought of buildings not as separate architectural entities but as parts of an organic whole that included the land, the community, and the society. In a very real way the houses of colonial New England and some of the southern plantations had been functional, but Wright was the ﬁrst architect to make functionalism the authoritative principle for public as well as for domestic buildings. As early as 1906 he built the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois, the ﬁrst of those churches that did so much to revolutionize ecclesiastical architecture in the United States. Thereafter he turned his genius to such miscellaneous structures as houses, schools, oﬃce buildings, and factories, among them the famous Larkin Building in Buffalo, New York, and the Johnson Wax Company building in Racine, Wisconsin.   The phrase “taken to heart” in line 1 is closest in meaning to which of the following? (A)  Taken seriously (B)  Criticized (C)  Memorized (D)  Taken offence ​</a>

                                            In the 1890s, bicycles became quite popular in the United States as the
new “safety” bicycles replaced the older penny-farthing bicycles. On the
penny-farthing bicycles, one wheel was much larger than the other, and these
bicycles were not very stable; they were always falling over. On the new
“safety” bicycles, both wheels were equal in size, and they were much easier
to control.
Many women also enjoyed these new “safety” bicycles, but they had to
take measures to deal with their clothing while riding the bicycles. The fashion
at the time was for long, full skirts that did not go well with bicycles. Some
women put lead weights in their skirts to keep their skirts from blowing up.
Other women changed from long skirts to bloomers, which were long, full,
wide pants, but some people felt that bloomers were inappropriate for women
to wear; in fact, some newspaper and magazines of the day criticized the new
bicycles fashion as a danger to ladies’ morals.
1.The passage is mainly about
a.The lack of stability of the penny-farthing bicycles.
b.The differences between safety and penny-farthing bicycles
c.Women’s fashions in the nineteenth century
d.the popularity of safety bicycles, even among women.

Prophet Muhammad died in Aisha's apartment as his head was lying on her knees. Aisha lived 47 years more after her beloved husband's death. She acted as a wise person of the ummah in Medina. Many hadiths come from her. The prophet loved her much and called her "Humayra" (White Face). Ali ibn Abu Talib refers to her as "the darling of Muhammad."
Although she remained silent politically during her father Abu Bakr's caliphate and also under Umar ibn al-Khattab's rule, Aisha became a political figure during the Uthman and Ali periods. She opposed some decisions of Uthman and she openly acted against Ali. For some years, she was like a leader of the opposition. She even fought two battles against Ali's forces and lost against him. After that, Aisha kept silent as a political figure until her death in 678. However, she criticized Muawiyah, too, from time to time, though she lived in tranquility in Medina.
Aisha was also a religious leader. Women always asked her what to do or what the prophet did in his life. Umar ibn al-Khattab also asked her advice, especially for women's matters.
Aisha knew the Quran and Sunnah (sayings and actions of Muhammad) very well. She was an intelligent person with a deep memory and good, sharp judgm

                            12. In the 1890s, bicycles became quite popular in the United States as the
new "safety" bicycles replaced the older penny-farthing bicycles. On the
penny-farthing bicycles, one wheel was much larger than the other, and these bicycles were not very stable; they were always falling over. On the new "safety" bicycles, both wheels were equal in size, and they were much easier to control.
Many women also enjoyed these new "safety" bicycles, but they had to take measures to deal with their clothing while riding the bicycles. The fashion at the time was for long, full skirts that did not go well with bicycles. Some women put lead weights in their skirts to keep their skirts from blowing up. Other women changed from long skirts to bloomers, which were long, full, wide pants, but some people felt that bloomers were inappropriate for women to wear; in fact, some newspaper and magazines of the day criticized the new bicycles fashion as a danger to ladies' morals.

Public defender Azas Tigor Nainggolan criticized the social punishment handed to COVID-19 health protocol violators - which involves placing a person inside a coffin - amidst the transitional period of social restriction shows the Jakarta Administration’s lack of seriousness in imposing punishments. “There is no such thing legal wise. That is being out of control. Placing a person inside a coffin seems like a buffoonery and gives the impression that the city administration is not serious in enforcing the law,” said Tigor to Tempo on Friday, September 4. The Jakarta Residents Forum (Fakta) coordinator also argued that the unclear handling of violators is rooted in ambiguous regulations. Tigor added that it reflects how city officials fail to understand the behavior of its own residents during a social restriction, including the sanction mechanism and supervisory. He also questioned the 'coffin punishment' from a health standpoint as the coffin that is used is shared among other violators. In principle, Tigor believes punishments must act as a deterrent and that the important aspect is to be consistent in implementing it. ​</h2><br />

Cuypers, the architect of the stationdeliberately built it to prevent the railway line passingthrough the heart of the cityThe design of the building with its mixture of gothic andDutch renaissance styles has been critized, but the intentionof welcoming travelers through a grand entrance into the cityof amsterdam has definitely succeeded.The arms of the state has been sculptured in the center ofthe front gable with a lion on each side.

                            32. In the 1890s, bicycles became quite popular in the united states as the new "safety" bicycles replaced the older penny-farthing bicycles. On the penny-farthing bicycles, one wheel was much larger than the other, and these bicycles were not very stable; they were always falling over. On the new "safety" bicycles, both wheels were equal in size, and they were much easier to control. Many women also enjoyed these new "safety" bicycles, but they had to take measures to deal with their clothing while riding the bicycles. The fashion at the time was for long, full skirts that did not go well with bicycles. Some women put lead weights in their skirts to keep their skirts from blowing up. Other women changed from long skirts to bloomers, which were long, full, wide pants, but some people felt that bloomers were inappropriate for women to wear; in fact, some newspaper and magazines of the day criticized the new bicycles fashion as a danger to ladies’ morals</h2><br />

In a very real way the houses of colonial New England and some of the southern plantations had been functional, but Wright was the ﬁrst architect to make functionalism the authoritative principle for public as well as for domestic buildings. As early as 1906 he built the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois, the ﬁrst of those churches that did so much to revolutionize ecclesiastical architecture in the United States. Thereafter he turned his genius to such miscellaneous structures as houses, schools, oﬃce buildings, and factories, among them the famous Larkin Building in Buffalo, New York, and the Johnson Wax Company building in Racine, Wisconsin.   The phrase “taken to heart” in line 1 is closest in meaning to which of the following?

                            39. In the 1890s, bicycles became quite popular in the United States as the
new “safety” bicycles replaced the older penny-farthing bicycles. On the
penny-farthing bicycles, one wheel was much larger than the other, and these
bicycles were not very stable; they were always falling over. On the new
“safety” bicycles, both wheels were equal in size, and they were much easier
to control.
Many women also enjoyed these new “safety” bicycles, but they had to
take measures to deal with their clothing while riding the bicycles. The fashion
at the time was for long, full skirts that did not go well with bicycles. Some
women put lead weights in their skirts to keep their skirts from blowing up.
Other women changed from long skirts to bloomers, which were long, full,
wide pants, but some people felt that bloomers were inappropriate for women
to wear; in fact, some newspaper and magazines of the day criticized the new
bicycles fashion as a danger to ladies’ morals.

a.The lack of stability of the penny-farthing bicycles.
