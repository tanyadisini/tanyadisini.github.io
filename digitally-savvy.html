1.	Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.
2.	But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.
3.	Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.
4.	Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.
1.	Even the most seasoned and savvy clinician views lupus warily, considering it one of the most bewildering diseases in all of medicine. This situation should not be a surprise since the manifestations of lupus are dizzying in their variety and exasperating in their subtlety. Furthermore, although lupus has been at the heart of immunology research for decades, investigators have yet to figure out its basis. Lupus represents a blatant violat-ion of the most fundamental laws of the immune system. Nevertheless, the disturbances that dangerously turn self into non-self remain totally obscure.
2.	The image of lupus adds to the confusion, although lupus actually has two competing images. These images, despite their differences, represent lupus's trademarks, its 'brand identity' so to speak. Lupus got its name from the wolf; its usual symbol, however, is the butterfly. I doubt that there are any two species as unlike one another in attitude, color, and emotional resonance as the wolf and the butterfly. Even if a misnomer, the word schizophrenic rightly describes this fierce battle of identity.
3.	Branding a specific disease with the image of a creature comes with its hazards, and efforts to link a disease with a member of the animal kingdom are, in fact, unusual. Among the few associations that come to mind are icthyosis to describe skin that looks like fish scales; leonine facies, the lion-like visage of patients with lepromatous leprosy; and elephantiasis, the thickened skin and bulging extremities from filariasis.</a>

'Beauty and the Beast:' One more time
Disney's reprise of its 1991 animated hit should please old fans and make some new ones.
The idea that love can break the spell of a powerful curse sounds as familiar to us as fairy tales themselves. In the case of Beauty and the Beast -- as imagined by Disney in a new live action version of its 1991 animated edition -- the Beast, a callous prince who has been cursed by a haggard old woman, must find love before the last petal drops off a rose kept in his dank castle. Absent such a love, the Beast and a gaggle of courtiers who've been turned into inanimate objects forever will be doomed to their cursed fates.
Disney's lavish remake its 26-year-old animated classic, Beauty and the Beastt, created little by way of anticipatory excitement for me. I'm no fan of remakes that take advantage of advances in digital technology just to wow us, in this case with talking versions of a clock, a teapot, a candelabra and a feather duster. And, yes, these digitally created do-dads probably show more personality than some of the story's human characters.
Having said that, this version -- starring Emma Watson (Beauty), Dan Stevens (Beast) and directed by Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) -- has enough whimsy and amusement to satisfy those who also will be buoyed by reprises of the Alan Menken/Tim Rice musical numbers -- with a couple of new additions.
Much of the credit for the movie's engaging collection of talking bric-a-brac goes to the actors who supplied the voice work: Emma Thompson voices Mrs. Potts, the teacup; Stanley Tucci gives life to as Maestro Cadenza, a harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw adds her vocal prowess to Plumette, the feather duster. The voice behind Cogsworth, the clock, belongs to Ian McKellen; and Ewan McGregor can be heard as Lumiere, a dashing candelabra.
Condon spices things up with references to Busby Berkeley, a ton of production design, a major investment in costumes and a generally capable cast that includes Luke Evans as the impossibly conceited and ultimately duplicitous Gaston and Josh Gad as his loyal sidekick LeFou.
You've probably read that Disney has made LeFou a gay character. That may be daring for a Disney version of Beauty and the Beast, but nothing in this upbeat entertainment seems designed to take the glow off the movie's mass-appeal luster.
The film even neuters the Beast, who has been given a leonine countenance -- with horns and bad teeth added for the sake of fright. This Beast makes threats on which he fails to deliver, and isn't quite as self-assured in his menace as you might expect.
Still, he's softened by Beauty, and by the end, it's difficult to say that anyone would mind if the Beast remained a beast rather than returning to his more Disnified form as a devilishly handsome prince.
In a nice touch, Beauty and the Beast begin their rapprochement when Belle (Beauty) discovers that the Beast has a well-stocked library. She's an avid reader, evidently the only one in the tiny village she and her father (Kevin Kline) call home.
There have, of course, been numerous versions of this 18th century tale from Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Velqleneuve, including Jean Cocteau's landmark 1946 version, but classic stories seem capable of enduring as many retellings as anyone possibly could desire.
This one opts for a visual razzle-dazzle that plays against Watson's plucky but somewhat ordinary Belle. I wouldn't say that Condon and company achieve perfection, but they've provided a lively, entertaining version of Disney's animated entry from the 1990s.
If we were going to have another Beauty and the Beast, I'm not sure what more we could have justifiably asked or expected.</a>

10	THINGS EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE do not DO 
Emotional intelligence is probably the most powerful yet undervalued trait in our society. 
We believe in rooting our everyday functions in logic and reason, yet we come to the same conclusions after long periods of contemplation as we do in the blink of an eye4. Our leaders sorely overlook the human element of our sociopolitical issues and I need not cite the divorce rate for you to believe that we're not choosing the right partners (nor do we have the capacity to sustain intimate relationships for long periods of time). 
It seems people believe the most intelligent thing to do is not have emotions at all. To be effective is to be a machine, a product of the age. A well-oiled, consumerist-serving, digitally attuned, highly unaware but overtly operational robot. And so we suffer. 
Here are the habits of the people who have the capacity to be aware of what they feel. Who know how to express, process, dismantle, and adjust their experience as they are their own locus of control. They are the true leaders, they are living the most whole and genuine lives, and it is from them we should be taking a cue. These are the things that emotionally intelligent people do not do. 
01.	They don't assume that the way they think and feel about a situation is the way it is in reality, nor how it will turn out in the end. They recognize their emotions as responses, not accurate gauges, of what's going on. They accept that those responses may have to do with their own issues, rather than the objective situation at hand. 
02.	Their emotional base points are not external. 
Their emotions aren't "somebody else's doing," and therefore "somebody else's problem to resolve." Understanding that they are the ultimate cause of what they experience keeps them out of falling into the trap of indignant passivity: Where one believes that as the universe has done wrong, the universe will ultimately have to correct it. 
03.	They don't assume to know what it is that will make them truly happy. 
Being that our only frame of reference at any given time is what's happened in the past, we actually have no means to determine what would make us truly happy, as opposed to just feeling "saved" from whatever we disliked about our past experiences. In understanding this, they open themselves up to any experience that their life evolves toward, knowing there are equal parts good and bad in anything.

                                            SOAL NOMOR 2 Kewirausahaan telah menjadi simbol ketahanan bisnis dan prestasi. Kepekaan seorang pengusaha terhadap peluang, kemampuan berinovasi, dan kemampuan berprestasi telah menjadi ukuran standar perusahaan yang luas sekarang ini. Kita telah melalui Revolusi Wirausaha di seluruh dunia. Revolusi pada abad kedua puluh satu ini lebih kuat dari Revolusi Industri pada abad kedua puluh. Pengusaha akan terus menjadi kontributor penting bagi pertumbuhan ekonomi melalui kepemimpinan mereka, manajemen, inovasi, penelitian dan efektivitas pembangunan, penciptaan lapangan kerja, daya saing, produktivitas, dan pembentukan industri baru. (Kuratko &amp; Hodgetts, 2007).   Kepemimpinan kewirausahaan kini menempuh strategi lebih besar terhadap organisasi yang didirikan. Entrepreneur merupakan upaya mencapai keunggulan dalam bersaing karena sebuah organisasi menyadari bahwa mereka terus-menerus mendefinisi ulang pasar, merestrukturisasi kegiatan, memodifikasi model bisnis dan mempelajari kemampuan berpikir mereka (Ireland &amp; Webb, 2007).   Sementara itu, kaitan kepemimpinan entrepreneur dengan bidang di luar bisnis, Patricia W Ingraham &amp; Heather G Taylor (2004) menyatakan sebagai berikut : Entrepreneurial leadership models are also beginning to mark the public sector. Numerous scholars have noted that there is increasing evidence of innovative or entrepreneurial leadership behavior by employees located at all levels of public organizations—and this phenomenon has been linked to enhanced public sector effectiveness. Adapun definisi Kepemimpinan Entrepreneurial menurut Esiri  adalah kepemimpinan yang memimpin secara inovatif, terlibat penuh dalam bekerja, mampu melihat peluang dan memanfaatkannya menurut cara dan metodenya sendiri. Selanjutnya Dave Lavinsky, berpendapat bahwa kepemimpinan entrepreneur memiliki karakteristik sebagai berikut : •        Communicate effectively with them  •        Possessing technical skills: While the leader may not need to have the greatest technical skills in their organizations, they need to be savvy enough to lead the team. •        Accepting responsibility for actions: Leaders and companies always make mistakes. Great leaders don’t place blame on others.   Menurut Ireland dan Hitt ,  dalam Kuratko dan Hodgetts  komponen-komponen kepemimpinan entrepreneur adalah : •      exploiting and maintaining the core competencies •        sustaining an effective organizational culture control   Pertanyaan : •     Saudara diminta untuk menjelaskan dari karakteristik /Komponen  tersebut dengan membuat  indikator dalam bentuk pernyataan atau pertanyaan dari Dave Lavisnsky atau dari Ireland dan Hit ( pilih salah satu )  sesuai dengan tempat dimana saudara bekerja (masing –masing 2 option ) •        Hambatan –hambatan apa yang akan dihadapi para pemimpin apabila menerapkan kepemimpinan entrepreneur ini diiplementasikan pada organisasi dimana saudara bekerja. ​</a>

The idea that love can break the spell of a powerful curse sounds as familiar to us as fairy tales themselves. In the case of Beauty and the Beast -- as imagined by Disney in a new live action version of its 1991 animated edition -- the Beast, a callous prince who has been cursed by a haggard old woman, must find love before the last petal drops off a rose kept in his dank castle. Absent such a love, the Beast and a gaggle of courtiers who've been turned into inanimate objects forever will be doomed to their cursed fates.
Disney's lavish remake its 26-year-old animated classic, Beauty and the Beastt, created little by way of anticipatory excitement for me. I'm no fan of remakes that take advantage of advances in digital technology just to wow us, in this case with talking versions of a clock, a teapot, a candelabra and a feather duster. And, yes, these digitally created do-dads probably show more personality than some of the story's human characters.
Having said that, this version -- starring Emma Watson (Beauty), Dan Stevens (Beast) and directed by Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) -- has enough whimsy and amusement to satisfy those who also will be buoyed by reprises of the Alan Menken/Tim Rice musical numbers -- with a couple of new additions.
Much of the credit for the movie's engaging collection of talking bric-a-brac goes to the actors who supplied the voice work: Emma Thompson voices Mrs. Potts, the teacup; Stanley Tucci gives life to as Maestro Cadenza, a harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw adds her vocal prowess to Plumette, the feather duster. The voice behind Cogsworth, the clock, belongs to Ian McKellen; and Ewan McGregor can be heard as Lumiere, a dashing candelabra.
Condon spices things up with references to Busby Berkeley, a ton of production design, a major investment in costumes and a generally capable cast that includes Luke Evans as the impossibly conceited and ultimately duplicitous Gaston and Josh Gad as his loyal sidekick LeFou.
You've probably read that Disney has made LeFou a gay character. That may be daring for a Disney version of Beauty and the Beast, but nothing in this upbeat entertainment seems designed to take the glow off the movie's mass-appeal luster.
The film even neuters the Beast, who has been given a leonine countenance -- with horns and bad teeth added for the sake of fright. This Beast makes threats on which he fails to deliver, and isn't quite as self-assured in his menace as you might expect.
Still, he's softened by Beauty, and by the end, it's difficult to say that anyone would mind if the Beast remained a beast rather than returning to his more Disnified form as a devilishly handsome prince.
In a nice touch, Beauty and the Beast begin their rapprochement when Belle (Beauty) discovers that the Beast has a well-stocked library. She's an avid reader, evidently the only one in the tiny village she and her father (Kevin Kline) call home.
There have, of course, been numerous versions of this 18th century tale from Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Velqleneuve, including Jean Cocteau's landmark 1946 version, but classic stories seem capable of enduring as many retellings as anyone possibly could desire.
This one opts for a visual razzle-dazzle that plays against Watson's plucky but somewhat ordinary Belle. I wouldn't say that Condon and company achieve perfection, but they've provided a lively, entertaining version of Disney's animated entry from the 1990s.
If we were going to have another Beauty and the Beast, I'm not sure what more we could have justifiably asked or expected.

Those in the retail industry that are successful in digitally transforming will be ones that leverage technology to innovate around an immersive and disruptive customer experience. These "lighthouse" retailers are the ones driving innovation, adopting emerging technologies early, and showing the industry what works and is possible. They are the ones experimenting with new models and store formats, playing with recombinations/reconfigurations of scale, assets, product, place, and people. The "store of the future" is the keystone of this effort.
The store of the future will combine multiple formats to deliver an immersive and unique experience across all customer touchpoints online and in the store. It will be heavily instrumented for operational efficiency and digitally connected end-to-end to leverage a single view of customer, product, and order. The store of the future – despite its reliance on sophisticated technology and infrastructure – will be trying to look smaller and less intimidating, more personalized, and frictionless.
The deployment of these and other digital technologies in disruptive ways can turn visitors into shoppers and shoppers into brand-loyal customers. However, understanding which consumers want personalization and which want contextualized and relevant experiences, while protecting everyone’s privacy, has grown more difficult. With so much at stake, data privacy has become a challenge for every party involved.

                                            SOAL NOMOR 2 Kewirausahaan telah menjadi simbol ketahanan bisnis dan prestasi. Kepekaan seorang pengusaha terhadap peluang, kemampuan berinovasi, dan kemampuan berprestasi telah menjadi ukuran standar perusahaan yang luas sekarang ini. Kita telah melalui Revolusi Wirausaha di seluruh dunia. Revolusi pada abad kedua puluh satu ini lebih kuat dari Revolusi Industri pada abad kedua puluh. Pengusaha akan terus menjadi kontributor penting bagi pertumbuhan ekonomi melalui kepemimpinan mereka, manajemen, inovasi, penelitian dan efektivitas pembangunan, penciptaan lapangan kerja, daya saing, produktivitas, dan pembentukan industri baru. (Kuratko &amp; Hodgetts, 2007).   Kepemimpinan kewirausahaan kini menempuh strategi lebih besar terhadap organisasi yang didirikan. Entrepreneur merupakan upaya mencapai keunggulan dalam bersaing karena sebuah organisasi menyadari bahwa mereka terus-menerus mendefinisi ulang pasar, merestrukturisasi kegiatan, memodifikasi model bisnis dan mempelajari kemampuan berpikir mereka (Ireland &amp; Webb, 2007).   Sementara itu, kaitan kepemimpinan entrepreneur dengan bidang di luar bisnis, Patricia W Ingraham &amp; Heather G Taylor (2004) menyatakan sebagai berikut : Entrepreneurial leadership models are also beginning to mark the public sector. Numerous scholars have noted that there is increasing evidence of innovative or entrepreneurial leadership behavior by employees located at all levels of public organizations—and this phenomenon has been linked to enhanced public sector effectiveness. Adapun definisi Kepemimpinan Entrepreneurial menurut Esiri  adalah kepemimpinan yang memimpin secara inovatif, terlibat penuh dalam bekerja, mampu melihat peluang dan memanfaatkannya menurut cara dan metodenya sendiri. Selanjutnya Dave Lavinsky, berpendapat bahwa kepemimpinan entrepreneur memiliki karakteristik sebagai berikut : •        Communicate effectively with them •        Possessing technical skills: While the leader may not need to have the greatest technical skills in their organizations, they need to be savvy enough to lead the team. •        Accepting responsibility for actions: Leaders and companies always make mistakes. Great leaders don’t place blame on others.   Menurut Ireland dan Hitt ,  dalam Kuratko dan Hodgetts  komponen-komponen kepemimpinan entrepreneur adalah : •      exploiting and maintaining the core competencies •        sustaining an effective organizational culture control   Pertanyaan : •     Saudara diminta untuk menjelaskan dari karakteristik /Komponen  tersebut dengan membuat  indikator dalam bentuk pernyataan atau pertanyaan dari Dave Lavisnsky atau dari Ireland dan Hit ( pilih salah satu )  sesuai dengan tempat dimana saudara bekerja (masing –masing 2 option ) •        Hambatan –hambatan apa yang akan dihadapi para pemimpin apabila menerapkan kepemimpinan entrepreneur ini diiplementasikan pada organisasi dimana saudara bekerja. ​</a>

'Beauty and the Beast:' One more time
Disney's reprise of its 1991 animated hit should please old fans and make some new ones.
The idea that love can break the spell of a powerful curse sounds as familiar to us as fairy tales themselves. In the case of Beauty and the Beast -- as imagined by Disney in a new live action version of its 1991 animated edition -- the Beast, a callous prince who has been cursed by a haggard old woman, must find love before the last petal drops off a rose kept in his dank castle. Absent such a love, the Beast and a gaggle of courtiers who've been turned into inanimate objects forever will be doomed to their cursed fates.
Disney's lavish remake its 26-year-old animated classic, Beauty and the Beastt, created little by way of anticipatory excitement for me. I'm no fan of remakes that take advantage of advances in digital technology just to wow us, in this case with talking versions of a clock, a teapot, a candelabra and a feather duster. And, yes, these digitally created do-dads probably show more personality than some of the story's human characters.
Having said that, this version -- starring Emma Watson (Beauty), Dan Stevens (Beast) and directed by Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) -- has enough whimsy and amusement to satisfy those who also will be buoyed by reprises of the Alan Menken/Tim Rice musical numbers -- with a couple of new additions.
Much of the credit for the movie's engaging collection of talking bric-a-brac goes to the actors who supplied the voice work: Emma Thompson voices Mrs. Potts, the teacup; Stanley Tucci gives life to as Maestro Cadenza, a harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw adds her vocal prowess to Plumette, the feather duster. The voice behind Cogsworth, the clock, belongs to Ian McKellen; and Ewan McGregor can be heard as Lumiere, a dashing candelabra.
Condon spices things up with references to Busby Berkeley, a ton of production design, a major investment in costumes and a generally capable cast that includes Luke Evans as the impossibly conceited and ultimately duplicitous Gaston and Josh Gad as his loyal sidekick LeFou.
You've probably read that Disney has made LeFou a gay character. That may be daring for a Disney version of Beauty and the Beast, but nothing in this upbeat entertainment seems designed to take the glow off the movie's mass-appeal luster.
The film even neuters the Beast, who has been given a leonine countenance -- with horns and bad teeth added for the sake of fright. This Beast makes threats on which he fails to deliver, and isn't quite as self-assured in his menace as you might expect.
Still, he's softened by Beauty, and by the end, it's difficult to say that anyone would mind if the Beast remained a beast rather than returning to his more Disnified form as a devilishly handsome prince.
In a nice touch, Beauty and the Beast begin their rapprochement when Belle (Beauty) discovers that the Beast has a well-stocked library. She's an avid reader, evidently the only one in the tiny village she and her father (Kevin Kline) call home.
There have, of course, been numerous versions of this 18th century tale from Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Velqleneuve, including Jean Cocteau's landmark 1946 version, but classic stories seem capable of enduring as many retellings as anyone possibly could desire.
This one opts for a visual razzle-dazzle that plays against Watson's plucky but somewhat ordinary Belle. I wouldn't say that Condon and company achieve perfection, but they've provided a lively, entertaining version of Disney's animated entry from the 1990s.
If we were going to have another Beauty and the Beast, I'm not sure what more we could have justifiably asked or expected.</a>

                                            CARILAH IDE" POKOK TEKS DI BAWAH INIPolitics in the age of media convergence differs from a few decades ago.Citizens now have more outlets in expressing their thought by utilizing social media and messaging apps to respond to the news and give unsolicited commentaries on the most-debated subject in political affairs.  The use of hashtags and memes are prevalent. The meme is described by the academic Limor Shifman as a digital and user-generated content comprising one or a combined element of multimedia items.The basic ingredients of meme could be a simple picture of renowned persons edited anonymously, often with a short text or conversation bubble. This ranges from the making of a picture of lawmakers, top politicians, ministers or presidents, featuring their unique and signature facial expressions which are digitally edited and cluttered with funny or satirical message to a short clip, whose dubbing and subtitles are altered to serve a certain purpose.The meme circulating across social media timelines signifies public creativity, resulting from cyber activism and increased voluntary engagement by citizens in the public narrative, thanks to the widespread ownership of handheld gadgets.Indonesian netizen’s eagerness in using social media reflects the nation’s culture of participation in the digital era. In early 2017, Twitter reported Indonesia was the fifth country of Twitter users, with some  4.1 billion tweets sent from the country. Both trends indicate a high degree of activity and intense flow of online (accessible) content which at any rates are searchable worldwide through tracking a line of hashtag.The apparent fondness of engaging in public debate and reacting to the political narrative via social media substantiates a premise that highly political matter is not only a theme of discussion raised by high-profile policy makers, but cascading down to everyday conversation among ordinary citizens.  This reality is nevertheless susceptible to the irresponsible and derogatory content attributable to meme’s anonymous nature.Some years ago,  ideas or aspirations were best presented by the pressure of interest groups, political parties or  fractions in the legislature largely due to their ingrained power in persuading and mobilizing the masses. With the advent of digital communication the origin of social change initially driven by ideas is no longer sourced from the formal, hierarchical and structured institution. Instead, internet has capacitated individuals to pitch their own opinion, initiate a movement, and land themselves in a circumstance equally influential to that of formal political forces.Internet memes feed the cyberspace with ideas, a subtle movement, and political campaign. Meme diffusion which  easily escalates from a content merely shared by an individual to an item rapidly consumed by masses, highlights an important feature of broad reachability and friendliness to all segments of society, which is essential for political framing. As noted by Shifman, memes encapsulate a pot of ideas, communicative technique, and textually powerful social interaction.The researchers Colin Lankshear and Michele Knobel take memes even more seriously; though meme’s coverage is at the micro level (individual-to-individual), its repercussion is larger than its scope of diffusion. It can shape mindsets, social behavior and attitudes of numerous social groups.Meme functions as a presenter of ideas that conceals or clearly pitches a subjective interest.Take a viral meme created on Susi Pudjiastuti, the popular Fisheries and Marine Affairs Minister. Her campaign on consuming fish for a healthy diet is made into a meme with a twist on her campaign against illegal fishing: “… anyone who doesn’t eat fish, I will sink them”. A jargon, tagline, motto, and a short quote on a picture sums up a key message  at the end.The underlying issue of market sustainability in fisheries is a complex process involving supply and demand balancing effort, national purchasing power, and maritime culture cultivation that entails problem solving. One solution is promoting fish consumption across the nation, also for the population’s health. Indeed, the promotion is at the heart of government’s interest, which received huge public response. Susi’s popularity appeared to increase; the meme seemed to have successfully helped the government policy in promoting fish consumption.Meme flourishes because it benefits from internet penetration and regular use of social networking sites: shareability and readability. Passing a meme to others is not burdensome. Meanwhile an immense degree of readability occurs when even the most digitally-illiterate people can still access the meaning ascribed to a meme. Both aspects have made meme popularly circulated amongst citizens.</a>

                                            10 THINGS EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE do not DO 
Emotional intelligence is probably the most powerful yet undervalued trait in our society. 
We believe in rooting our everyday functions in logic and reason, yet we come to the same conclusions after long periods of contemplation as we do in the blink of an eye4. Our leaders sorely overlook the human element of our sociopolitical issues and I need not cite the divorce rate for you to believe that we're not choosing the right partners (nor do we have the capacity to sustain intimate relationships for long periods of time). 
It seems people believe the most intelligent thing to do is not have emotions at all. To be effective is to be a machine, a product of the age. A well-oiled, consumerist-serving, digitally attuned, highly unaware but overtly operational robot. And so we suffer. 
Here are the habits of the people who have the capacity to be aware of what they feel. Who know how to express, process, dismantle, and adjust their experience as they are their own locus of control. They are the true leaders, they are living the most whole and genuine lives, and it is from them we should be taking a cue. These are the things that emotionally intelligent people do not do. 
01. They don't assume that the way they think and feel about a situation is the way it is in reality, nor how it will turn out in the end. They recognize their emotions as responses, not accurate gauges, of what's going on. They accept that those responses may have to do with their own issues, rather than the objective situation at hand. 
02. Their emotional base points are not external. 
Their emotions aren't "somebody else's doing," and therefore "somebody else's problem to resolve." Understanding that they are</a>

1.	Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.
2.	But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.
3.	Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.
4.	Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.
1.	Even the most seasoned and savvy clinician views lupus warily, considering it one of the most bewildering diseases in all of medicine. This situation should not be a surprise since the manifestations of lupus are dizzying in their variety and exasperating in their subtlety. Furthermore, although lupus has been at the heart of immunology research for decades, investigators have yet to figure out its basis. Lupus represents a blatant violat-ion of the most fundamental laws of the immune system. Nevertheless, the disturbances that dangerously turn self into non-self remain totally obscure.
2.	The image of lupus adds to the confusion, although lupus actually has two competing images. These images, despite their differences, represent lupus's trademarks, its 'brand identity' so to speak. Lupus got its name from the wolf; its usual symbol, however, is the butterfly. I doubt that there are any two species as unlike one another in attitude, color, and emotional resonance as the wolf and the butterfly. Even if a misnomer, the word schizophrenic rightly describes this fierce battle of identity.
3.	Branding a specific disease with the image of a creature comes with its hazards, and efforts to link a disease with a member of the animal kingdom are, in fact, unusual. Among the few associations that come to mind are icthyosis to describe skin that looks like fish scales; leonine facies, the lion-like visage of patients with lepromatous leprosy; and elephantiasis, the thickened skin and bulging extremities from filariasis.</h2><br />

'Beauty and the Beast:' One more time
Disney's reprise of its 1991 animated hit should please old fans and make some new ones.
The idea that love can break the spell of a powerful curse sounds as familiar to us as fairy tales themselves. In the case of Beauty and the Beast -- as imagined by Disney in a new live action version of its 1991 animated edition -- the Beast, a callous prince who has been cursed by a haggard old woman, must find love before the last petal drops off a rose kept in his dank castle. Absent such a love, the Beast and a gaggle of courtiers who've been turned into inanimate objects forever will be doomed to their cursed fates.
Disney's lavish remake its 26-year-old animated classic, Beauty and the Beastt, created little by way of anticipatory excitement for me. I'm no fan of remakes that take advantage of advances in digital technology just to wow us, in this case with talking versions of a clock, a teapot, a candelabra and a feather duster. And, yes, these digitally created do-dads probably show more personality than some of the story's human characters.
Having said that, this version -- starring Emma Watson (Beauty), Dan Stevens (Beast) and directed by Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) -- has enough whimsy and amusement to satisfy those who also will be buoyed by reprises of the Alan Menken/Tim Rice musical numbers -- with a couple of new additions.
Much of the credit for the movie's engaging collection of talking bric-a-brac goes to the actors who supplied the voice work: Emma Thompson voices Mrs. Potts, the teacup; Stanley Tucci gives life to as Maestro Cadenza, a harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw adds her vocal prowess to Plumette, the feather duster. The voice behind Cogsworth, the clock, belongs to Ian McKellen; and Ewan McGregor can be heard as Lumiere, a dashing candelabra.
Condon spices things up with references to Busby Berkeley, a ton of production design, a major investment in costumes and a generally capable cast that includes Luke Evans as the impossibly conceited and ultimately duplicitous Gaston and Josh Gad as his loyal sidekick LeFou.
You've probably read that Disney has made LeFou a gay character. That may be daring for a Disney version of Beauty and the Beast, but nothing in this upbeat entertainment seems designed to take the glow off the movie's mass-appeal luster.
The film even neuters the Beast, who has been given a leonine countenance -- with horns and bad teeth added for the sake of fright. This Beast makes threats on which he fails to deliver, and isn't quite as self-assured in his menace as you might expect.
Still, he's softened by Beauty, and by the end, it's difficult to say that anyone would mind if the Beast remained a beast rather than returning to his more Disnified form as a devilishly handsome prince.
In a nice touch, Beauty and the Beast begin their rapprochement when Belle (Beauty) discovers that the Beast has a well-stocked library. She's an avid reader, evidently the only one in the tiny village she and her father (Kevin Kline) call home.
There have, of course, been numerous versions of this 18th century tale from Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Velqleneuve, including Jean Cocteau's landmark 1946 version, but classic stories seem capable of enduring as many retellings as anyone possibly could desire.
This one opts for a visual razzle-dazzle that plays against Watson's plucky but somewhat ordinary Belle. I wouldn't say that Condon and company achieve perfection, but they've provided a lively, entertaining version of Disney's animated entry from the 1990s.
If we were going to have another Beauty and the Beast, I'm not sure what more we could have justifiably asked or expected.</h2><br />

Dalam kasus Beauty and the Beast - seperti yang dibayangkan oleh Disney dalam versi live action baru dari edisi animasi 1991 - the Beast, pangeran yang tidak berperasaan yang telah dikutuk oleh wanita tua yang kurus, harus menemukan cinta sebelum kelopak terakhir Menuruni mawar yang disimpan di istana danknya. Tidak ada cinta seperti itu, Binatang dan sekumpulan istana yang telah berubah menjadi benda mati selamanya akan ditakdirkan untuk menghadapi nasib terkutuk mereka.<br /><br />Ulang tahun Disney yang mewah dengan animasi klasik berusia 26 tahun, Beauty and the Beastt, menciptakan sedikit kegembiraan antisipasi bagi saya. Saya bukan penggemar remake yang memanfaatkan kemajuan teknologi digital hanya untuk menyayat hati kita, dalam hal ini dengan versi bicara jam, teko, candelabra dan kain lap. Dan, ya, orang-orang yang dibuat secara digital ini mungkin menunjukkan kepribadian lebih dari beberapa karakter manusia cerita.<br /><br />Setelah mengatakan bahwa, versi yang dibintangi Emma Watson (Beauty), Dan Stevens (Beast) dan disutradarai oleh Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) - memiliki cukup imajinasi dan kegembiraan untuk memuaskan orang-orang yang juga akan didukung oleh repetisi Alan Menken / Nomor musik Tim Rice - dengan beberapa tambahan baru.<br /><br />Sebagian besar pujian untuk koleksi menarik film tentang bric-a-brac berbicara kepada para aktor yang memasok karya suaranya: Emma Thompson menyuarakan Mrs. Potts, cangkir teh; Stanley Tucci memberi kehidupan sebagai Maestro Cadenza, sebuah harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw menambahkan kecakapan vokalnya pada Plumette, kain lap bulu. Suara di balik Cogsworth, jam, milik Ian McKellen; dan Ewan McGregor dapat didengar sebagai Lumiere, candelabra yang gagah berani.<br /><br />Condon membumbui semuanya dengan referensi ke Busby Berkeley, satu ton desain produksi, investasi utama dalam kostum dan pemeran yang umumnya mampu yang mencakup Luke Evans sebagai Gaston dan Josh Gad yang sangat sombong dan akhirnya mirip dengan sahabat karibnya LeFou.<br /><br />Anda mungkin pernah membaca bahwa Disney telah menjadikan LeFou karakter gay. Itu mungkin menantang versi Disney Beauty and the Beast, tapi tidak ada hiburan athebat ini yang tampaknya dirancang untuk melepaskan kilau dari kilasan permintaan massal film ini.<br /><br />Film ini bahkan mengotori Beast, yang telah diberi wajah leonine - dengan tanduk dan gigi buruk ditambahkan demi ketakutan. Binatang ini membuat ancaman yang tidak dapat dia sampaikan, dan tidak begitu percaya diri dalam ancamannya seperti yang Anda harapkan.<br /><br />Meski begitu, dia dilunakkan oleh Beauty, dan pada akhirnya, sulit untuk mengatakan bahwa ada orang yang keberatan jika Binatang itu tetap menjadi binatang daripada kembali ke bentuknya yang lebih Disnosis sebagai pangeran yang tampan.<br /><br />Dengan sentuhan yang bagus, Beauty and the Beast memulai persesuaian mereka saat Belle (Beauty) menemukan bahwa Binatang itu memiliki perpustakaan yang lengkap. Dia adalah seorang pembaca setia, ternyata satu-satunya di desa kecil yang dia dan ayahnya (Kevin Kline) telepon rumah.<br /><br />Tentu saja, ada banyak versi dari kisah abad ke 18 ini dari Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Velqleneuve, termasuk tengara Jean Cocteau pada tengara 1946, namun cerita klasik sepertinya mampu bertahan selama retellings sebanyak yang mungkin diinginkan orang.<br /><br />Yang satu ini memilih untuk menyilaukan visual yang mempesona melawan Belle yang ceroboh namun agak biasa. Saya tidak akan mengatakan bahwa Condon dan perusahaan mencapai kesempurnaan, tapi mereka telah menyediakan versi animasi Disney yang meriah dan menghibur dari tahun 1990an.<br /><br />Jika kita ingin memiliki Beauty and the Beast lagi, saya tidak yakin apa lagi yang bisa kita katakan atau harapkan.<br /><br /><br />

                            6. 3 
10	THINGS EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE do not DO 
Emotional intelligence is probably the most powerful yet undervalued trait in our society. 
We believe in rooting our everyday functions in logic and reason, yet we come to the same conclusions after long periods of contemplation as we do in the blink of an eye4. Our leaders sorely overlook the human element of our sociopolitical issues and I need not cite the divorce rate for you to believe that we're not choosing the right partners (nor do we have the capacity to sustain intimate relationships for long periods of time). 
It seems people believe the most intelligent thing to do is not have emotions at all. To be effective is to be a machine, a product of the age. A well-oiled, consumerist-serving, digitally attuned, highly unaware but overtly operational robot. And so we suffer. 
Here are the habits of the people who have the capacity to be aware of what they feel. Who know how to express, process, dismantle, and adjust their experience as they are their own locus of control. They are the true leaders, they are living the most whole and genuine lives, and it is from them we should be taking a cue. These are the things that emotionally intelligent people do not do. 
01.	They don't assume that the way they think and feel about a situation is the way it is in reality, nor how it will turn out in the end. They recognize their emotions as responses, not accurate gauges, of what's going on. They accept that those responses may have to do with their own issues, rather than the objective situation at hand. 
02.	Their emotional base points are not external. 
Their emotions aren't "somebody else's doing," and therefore "somebody else's problem to resolve." Understanding that they are the ultimate cause of what they experience keeps them out of falling into the trap of indignant passivity: Where one believes that as the universe has done wrong, the universe will ultimately have to correct it. 
03.	They don't assume to know what it is that will make them truly happy. 
Being that our only frame of reference at any given time is what's happened in the past, we actually have no means to determine what would make us truly happy, as opposed to just feeling "saved" from whatever we disliked about our past experiences. In understanding this, they open themselves up to any experience that their life evolves toward, knowing there are equal parts good and bad in anything.

                            9. SOAL NOMOR 2 Kewirausahaan telah menjadi simbol ketahanan bisnis dan prestasi. Kepekaan seorang pengusaha terhadap peluang, kemampuan berinovasi, dan kemampuan berprestasi telah menjadi ukuran standar perusahaan yang luas sekarang ini. Kita telah melalui Revolusi Wirausaha di seluruh dunia. Revolusi pada abad kedua puluh satu ini lebih kuat dari Revolusi Industri pada abad kedua puluh. Pengusaha akan terus menjadi kontributor penting bagi pertumbuhan ekonomi melalui kepemimpinan mereka, manajemen, inovasi, penelitian dan efektivitas pembangunan, penciptaan lapangan kerja, daya saing, produktivitas, dan pembentukan industri baru. (Kuratko &amp; Hodgetts, 2007).   Kepemimpinan kewirausahaan kini menempuh strategi lebih besar terhadap organisasi yang didirikan. Entrepreneur merupakan upaya mencapai keunggulan dalam bersaing karena sebuah organisasi menyadari bahwa mereka terus-menerus mendefinisi ulang pasar, merestrukturisasi kegiatan, memodifikasi model bisnis dan mempelajari kemampuan berpikir mereka (Ireland &amp; Webb, 2007).   Sementara itu, kaitan kepemimpinan entrepreneur dengan bidang di luar bisnis, Patricia W Ingraham &amp; Heather G Taylor (2004) menyatakan sebagai berikut : Entrepreneurial leadership models are also beginning to mark the public sector. Numerous scholars have noted that there is increasing evidence of innovative or entrepreneurial leadership behavior by employees located at all levels of public organizations—and this phenomenon has been linked to enhanced public sector effectiveness. Adapun definisi Kepemimpinan Entrepreneurial menurut Esiri  adalah kepemimpinan yang memimpin secara inovatif, terlibat penuh dalam bekerja, mampu melihat peluang dan memanfaatkannya menurut cara dan metodenya sendiri. Selanjutnya Dave Lavinsky, berpendapat bahwa kepemimpinan entrepreneur memiliki karakteristik sebagai berikut : •        Communicate effectively with them  •        Possessing technical skills: While the leader may not need to have the greatest technical skills in their organizations, they need to be savvy enough to lead the team. •        Accepting responsibility for actions: Leaders and companies always make mistakes. Great leaders don’t place blame on others.   Menurut Ireland dan Hitt ,  dalam Kuratko dan Hodgetts  komponen-komponen kepemimpinan entrepreneur adalah : •      exploiting and maintaining the core competencies •        sustaining an effective organizational culture control   Pertanyaan : •     Saudara diminta untuk menjelaskan dari karakteristik /Komponen  tersebut dengan membuat  indikator dalam bentuk pernyataan atau pertanyaan dari Dave Lavisnsky atau dari Ireland dan Hit ( pilih salah satu )  sesuai dengan tempat dimana saudara bekerja (masing –masing 2 option ) •        Hambatan –hambatan apa yang akan dihadapi para pemimpin apabila menerapkan kepemimpinan entrepreneur ini diiplementasikan pada organisasi dimana saudara bekerja. ​</h2><br />

Kita akan menghitung keuntungan dari masing-masing strategi berdasarkan jumlah konsumen yang datang dan probabilitas mereka untuk membeli dengan diskon.</p><p></p><p>Langkah-langkah untuk menghitung keuntungan dari masing-masing strategi adalah sebagai berikut:</p><p></p><p>1. Menghitung jumlah konsumen savvy dan impulsive yang datang ke toko "Gaya":</p><p>   - Jumlah konsumen: 8.000 orang</p><p>   - Konsumen savvy: 40% dari 8.000 = 3.200 orang</p><p>   - Konsumen impulsive: 60% dari 8.000 = 4.800 orang</p><p></p><p>2. Menghitung jumlah konsumen savvy dan impulsive yang membeli dengan diskon:</p><p>   - Pelanggan impulsive yang membeli dengan diskon: 40% dari 4.800 = 1.920 orang</p><p></p><p>3. Menghitung keuntungan dari strategi dengan diskon:</p><p>   - Keuntungan per produk yang terdiskon: Rp. 35.000 - 25% = Rp. 26.250</p><p>   - Total keuntungan dari strategi diskon: 1.920 x Rp. 26.250 = Rp. 50.400.000</p><p></p><p>4. Menghitung keuntungan dari strategi tanpa diskon:</p><p>   - Keuntungan per produk tanpa diskon: Rp. 35.000</p><p>   - Total keuntungan dari strategi tanpa diskon: (3.200 + 2.880) x Rp. 35.000 = Rp. 224.000.000</p><p></p><p>Setelah menghitung keuntungan dari masing-masing strategi, kita dapat melihat bahwa keuntungan dari strategi tanpa diskon lebih besar daripada strategi dengan diskon. Oleh karena itu, toko fashion "Gaya" sebaiknya tidak menerapkan diskon dan tetap menjual produk dengan harga normal sebesar Rp. 35.000.</p><p></p><p>Pertimbangan dalam mengambil keputusan ini adalah bahwa strategi tanpa diskon memberikan keuntungan yang lebih tinggi, sehingga toko "Gaya" dapat memperoleh pendapatan yang lebih besar dengan tidak memberikan diskon. Selain itu, toko "Gaya" dapat mempertahankan harga normalnya sehingga citra dan kualitas produknya tidak terdevaluasi. Hal ini akan memberikan dampak positif dalam jangka panjang bagi toko "Gaya" untuk tetap bersaing dengan toko saingannya "Serasi". Imam Sahroni Darmawan</p><br />

This one opts for a visual razzle-dazzle that plays against Watson's plucky but somewhat ordinary Belle. I wouldn't say that Condon and company achieve perfection, but they've provided a lively, entertaining version of Disney's animated entry from the 1990s.
If we were going to have another Beauty and the Beast, I'm not sure what more we could have justifiably asked or expected.

                            14. SOAL NOMOR 2 Kewirausahaan telah menjadi simbol ketahanan bisnis dan prestasi. Kepekaan seorang pengusaha terhadap peluang, kemampuan berinovasi, dan kemampuan berprestasi telah menjadi ukuran standar perusahaan yang luas sekarang ini. Kita telah melalui Revolusi Wirausaha di seluruh dunia. Revolusi pada abad kedua puluh satu ini lebih kuat dari Revolusi Industri pada abad kedua puluh. Pengusaha akan terus menjadi kontributor penting bagi pertumbuhan ekonomi melalui kepemimpinan mereka, manajemen, inovasi, penelitian dan efektivitas pembangunan, penciptaan lapangan kerja, daya saing, produktivitas, dan pembentukan industri baru. (Kuratko &amp; Hodgetts, 2007).   Kepemimpinan kewirausahaan kini menempuh strategi lebih besar terhadap organisasi yang didirikan. Entrepreneur merupakan upaya mencapai keunggulan dalam bersaing karena sebuah organisasi menyadari bahwa mereka terus-menerus mendefinisi ulang pasar, merestrukturisasi kegiatan, memodifikasi model bisnis dan mempelajari kemampuan berpikir mereka (Ireland &amp; Webb, 2007). Sementara itu, kaitan kepemimpinan entrepreneur dengan bidang di luar bisnis, Patricia W Ingraham &amp; Heather G Taylor (2004) menyatakan sebagai berikut : Entrepreneurial leadership models are also beginning to mark the public sector. Numerous scholars have noted that there is increasing evidence of innovative or entrepreneurial leadership behavior by employees located at all levels of public organizations—and this phenomenon has been linked to enhanced public sector effectiveness. Adapun definisi Kepemimpinan Entrepreneurial menurut Esiri  adalah kepemimpinan yang memimpin secara inovatif, terlibat penuh dalam bekerja, mampu melihat peluang dan memanfaatkannya menurut cara dan metodenya sendiri. Selanjutnya Dave Lavinsky, berpendapat bahwa kepemimpinan entrepreneur memiliki karakteristik sebagai berikut : •  Build trust and confidence among employees • Communicate effectively with them•  Seeking self-improvement: A great leader always seeks to become even better.  •   Possessing technical skills: While the leader may not need to have the greatest technical skills in their organizations, they need to be savvy enough to lead the team. •     Accepting responsibility for actions: Leaders and companies always make mistakes. Great leaders don’t place blame on others. •  Making decisions: Good leaders must make good and timely decisions. •  Being a role model: A leader must set an example to employees and guide them to excel.   Menurut Ireland dan Hitt ,  dalam Kuratko dan Hodgetts  komponen-komponen kepemimpinan entrepreneur adalah : •   determining the firm’s purpose or vision •    exploiting and maintaining the core                                           competencies •    developing human capital •    sustaining an effective organizational        culture •    emphasizing ethical practices •      establishing balanced organizational control   Pertanyaan : •        Saudara diminta untuk menjelaskan dari      karakteristik /Komponen  tersebut dengan membuat  indikator dalam bentuk pernyataan atau pertanyaan dari Dave Lavisnsky atau dari Ireland dan Hit ( pilih salah satu )  sesuai dengan tempat dimana saudara bekerja (masing –masing 2 option ) •   Hambatan –hambatan apa yang akan dihadapi para pemimpin apabila menerapkan kepemimpinan entrepreneur ini diiplementasikan pada organisasi dimana saudara bekerja.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>1.	Indikator dari karakteristik/komponen kepemimpinan entrepreneur: a. Dari Dave Lavinsky:</p><p>•	Build trust and confidence among employees: Apakah para karyawan merasa percaya dan yakin terhadap pimpinan mereka? Apakah terdapat saling kepercayaan antara karyawan dan pimpinan?</p><p>•	Seeking self-improvement: Apakah pimpinan Anda selalu mencari cara untuk meningkatkan diri? Apakah pimpinan Anda mengambil langkah-langkah untuk terus belajar dan berkembang?</p><p>•	Making decisions: Apakah pimpinan Anda mampu membuat keputusan yang tepat dan dalam waktu yang tepat?</p><p>•	Being a role model: Apakah pimpinan Anda menunjukkan contoh yang baik bagi karyawan dalam hal kinerja, etika, dan tanggung jawab?</p><p>b. Dari Ireland dan Hitt:</p><p>•	Determining the firm’s purpose or vision: Apakah organisasi Anda memiliki tujuan yang jelas? Apakah tujuan ini disosialisasikan dengan baik kepada seluruh karyawan?</p><p>•	Developing human capital: Apakah organisasi Anda memberikan pelatihan dan pengembangan karyawan secara berkala? Apakah organisasi Anda menghargai dan memperhatikan kebutuhan pengembangan karir karyawan?</p><p>•	Emphasizing ethical practices: Apakah organisasi Anda memiliki kebijakan etika yang jelas?

Hambatan-hambatan yang akan dihadapi dalam menerapkan kepemimpinan entrepreneur:</p><p>•	Kurangnya dukungan atau resistensi dari karyawan yang sudah terbiasa dengan cara-cara lama</p><p>•	Tidak adanya anggaran yang cukup untuk mengimplementasikan strategi inovatif</p><p>•	Tidak adanya dukungan dari pihak manajemen yang lebih tinggi dalam organisasi</p><p>•	Terbatasnya waktu untuk menerapkan perubahan yang diperlukan</p><p>•	Kurangnya kepercayaan dari para pemegang saham atau investor terhadap ide-ide inovatif yang diusulkan</p><p>•	Tidak adanya sumber daya manusia yang memadai atau keterbatasan sumber daya manusia dalam membangun tim yang inovatif.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Those in the retail industry that are successful in digitally transforming will be ones that leverage technology to innovate around an immersive and disruptive customer experience. These "lighthouse" retailers are the ones driving innovation, adopting emerging technologies early, and showing the industry what works and is possible. They are the ones experimenting with new models and store formats, playing with recombinations/reconfigurations of scale, assets, product, place, and people. The "store of the future" is the keystone of this effort.
The store of the future will combine multiple formats to deliver an immersive and unique experience across all customer touchpoints online and in the store. It will be heavily instrumented for operational efficiency and digitally connected end-to-end to leverage a single view of customer, product, and order. The store of the future – despite its reliance on sophisticated technology and infrastructure – will be trying to look smaller and less intimidating, more personalized, and frictionless.
The deployment of these and other digital technologies in disruptive ways can turn visitors into shoppers and shoppers into brand-loyal customers. However, understanding which consumers want personalization and which want contextualized and relevant experiences, while protecting everyone’s privacy, has grown more difficult. With so much at stake, data privacy has become a challenge for every party involved.

'Beauty and the Beast:' One more time
Disney's reprise of its 1991 animated hit should please old fans and make some new ones.
The idea that love can break the spell of a powerful curse sounds as familiar to us as fairy tales themselves. In the case of Beauty and the Beast -- as imagined by Disney in a new live action version of its 1991 animated edition -- the Beast, a callous prince who has been cursed by a haggard old woman, must find love before the last petal drops off a rose kept in his dank castle. Absent such a love, the Beast and a gaggle of courtiers who've been turned into inanimate objects forever will be doomed to their cursed fates.
Disney's lavish remake its 26-year-old animated classic, Beauty and the Beastt, created little by way of anticipatory excitement for me. I'm no fan of remakes that take advantage of advances in digital technology just to wow us, in this case with talking versions of a clock, a teapot, a candelabra and a feather duster. And, yes, these digitally created do-dads probably show more personality than some of the story's human characters.
Having said that, this version -- starring Emma Watson (Beauty), Dan Stevens (Beast) and directed by Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) -- has enough whimsy and amusement to satisfy those who also will be buoyed by reprises of the Alan Menken/Tim Rice musical numbers -- with a couple of new additions.
Much of the credit for the movie's engaging collection of talking bric-a-brac goes to the actors who supplied the voice work: Emma Thompson voices Mrs. Potts, the teacup; Stanley Tucci gives life to as Maestro Cadenza, a harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw adds her vocal prowess to Plumette, the feather duster. The voice behind Cogsworth, the clock, belongs to Ian McKellen; and Ewan McGregor can be heard as Lumiere, a dashing candelabra.
Condon spices things up with references to Busby Berkeley, a ton of production design, a major investment in costumes and a generally capable cast that includes Luke Evans as the impossibly conceited and ultimately duplicitous Gaston and Josh Gad as his loyal sidekick LeFou.
You've probably read that Disney has made LeFou a gay character. That may be daring for a Disney version of Beauty and the Beast, but nothing in this upbeat entertainment seems designed to take the glow off the movie's mass-appeal luster.
The film even neuters the Beast, who has been given a leonine countenance -- with horns and bad teeth added for the sake of fright. This Beast makes threats on which he fails to deliver, and isn't quite as self-assured in his menace as you might expect.
Still, he's softened by Beauty, and by the end, it's difficult to say that anyone would mind if the Beast remained a beast rather than returning to his more Disnified form as a devilishly handsome prince.
In a nice touch, Beauty and the Beast begin their rapprochement when Belle (Beauty) discovers that the Beast has a well-stocked library. She's an avid reader, evidently the only one in the tiny village she and her father (Kevin Kline) call home.
There have, of course, been numerous versions of this 18th century tale from Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Velqleneuve, including Jean Cocteau's landmark 1946 version, but classic stories seem capable of enduring as many retellings as anyone possibly could desire.
This one opts for a visual razzle-dazzle that plays against Watson's plucky but somewhat ordinary Belle. I wouldn't say that Condon and company achieve perfection, but they've provided a lively, entertaining version of Disney's animated entry from the 1990s.
If we were going to have another Beauty and the Beast, I'm not sure what more we could have justifiably asked or expected.</h2><br />

Dalam kasus Beauty and the Beast - seperti yang dibayangkan oleh Disney dalam versi live action baru dari edisi animasi 1991 - the Beast, pangeran yang tidak berperasaan yang telah dikutuk oleh wanita tua yang kurus, harus menemukan cinta sebelum kelopak terakhir Menuruni mawar yang disimpan di istana danknya. Tidak ada cinta seperti itu, Binatang dan sekumpulan istana yang telah berubah menjadi benda mati selamanya akan ditakdirkan untuk menghadapi nasib terkutuk mereka.<br /><br />Ulang tahun Disney yang mewah dengan animasi klasik berusia 26 tahun, Beauty and the Beastt, menciptakan sedikit kegembiraan antisipasi bagi saya. Saya bukan penggemar remake yang memanfaatkan kemajuan teknologi digital hanya untuk menyayat hati kita, dalam hal ini dengan versi bicara jam, teko, candelabra dan kain lap. Dan, ya, orang-orang yang dibuat secara digital ini mungkin menunjukkan kepribadian lebih dari beberapa karakter manusia cerita.<br /><br />Setelah mengatakan bahwa, versi yang dibintangi Emma Watson (Beauty), Dan Stevens (Beast) dan disutradarai oleh Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) - memiliki cukup imajinasi dan kegembiraan untuk memuaskan orang-orang yang juga akan didukung oleh repetisi Alan Menken / Nomor musik Tim Rice - dengan beberapa tambahan baru.<br /><br />Sebagian besar pujian untuk koleksi menarik film tentang bric-a-brac berbicara kepada para aktor yang memasok karya suaranya: Emma Thompson menyuarakan Mrs. Potts, cangkir teh; Stanley Tucci memberi kehidupan sebagai Maestro Cadenza, sebuah harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw menambahkan kecakapan vokalnya pada Plumette, kain lap bulu. Suara di balik Cogsworth, jam, milik Ian McKellen; dan Ewan McGregor dapat didengar sebagai Lumiere, candelabra yang gagah berani.<br /><br />Condon membumbui semuanya dengan referensi ke Busby Berkeley, satu ton desain produksi, investasi utama dalam kostum dan pemeran yang umumnya mampu yang mencakup Luke Evans sebagai Gaston dan Josh Gad yang sangat sombong dan akhirnya mirip dengan sahabat karibnya LeFou.<br /><br />Anda mungkin pernah membaca bahwa Disney telah menjadikan LeFou karakter gay. Itu mungkin menantang versi Disney Beauty and the Beast, tapi tidak ada hiburan athebat ini yang tampaknya dirancang untuk melepaskan kilau dari kilasan permintaan massal film ini.<br /><br />Film ini bahkan mengotori Beast, yang telah diberi wajah leonine - dengan tanduk dan gigi buruk ditambahkan demi ketakutan. Binatang ini membuat ancaman yang tidak dapat dia sampaikan, dan tidak begitu percaya diri dalam ancamannya seperti yang Anda harapkan.<br /><br />Meski begitu, dia dilunakkan oleh Beauty, dan pada akhirnya, sulit untuk mengatakan bahwa ada orang yang keberatan jika Binatang itu tetap menjadi binatang daripada kembali ke bentuknya yang lebih Disnosis sebagai pangeran yang tampan.<br /><br />Dengan sentuhan yang bagus, Beauty and the Beast memulai persesuaian mereka saat Belle (Beauty) menemukan bahwa Binatang itu memiliki perpustakaan yang lengkap. Dia adalah seorang pembaca setia, ternyata satu-satunya di desa kecil yang dia dan ayahnya (Kevin Kline) telepon rumah.<br /><br />Tentu saja, ada banyak versi dari kisah abad ke 18 ini dari Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Velqleneuve, termasuk tengara Jean Cocteau pada tengara 1946, namun cerita klasik sepertinya mampu bertahan selama retellings sebanyak yang mungkin diinginkan orang.<br /><br />Yang satu ini memilih untuk menyilaukan visual yang mempesona melawan Belle yang ceroboh namun agak biasa. Saya tidak akan mengatakan bahwa Condon dan perusahaan mencapai kesempurnaan, tapi mereka telah menyediakan versi animasi Disney yang meriah dan menghibur dari tahun 1990an.<br /><br />Jika kita ingin memiliki Beauty and the Beast lagi, saya tidak yakin apa lagi yang bisa kita katakan atau harapkan.<br /><br /><br />LIKE AND FOLLOWE<br />

                            32. CARILAH IDE" POKOK TEKS DI BAWAH INIPolitics in the age of media convergence differs from a few decades ago.Citizens now have more outlets in expressing their thought by utilizing social media and messaging apps to respond to the news and give unsolicited commentaries on the most-debated subject in political affairs.  The use of hashtags and memes are prevalent. The meme is described by the academic Limor Shifman as a digital and user-generated content comprising one or a combined element of multimedia items.The basic ingredients of meme could be a simple picture of renowned persons edited anonymously, often with a short text or conversation bubble. This ranges from the making of a picture of lawmakers, top politicians, ministers or presidents, featuring their unique and signature facial expressions which are digitally edited and cluttered with funny or satirical message to a short clip, whose dubbing and subtitles are altered to serve a certain purpose.The meme circulating across social media timelines signifies public creativity, resulting from cyber activism and increased voluntary engagement by citizens in the public narrative, thanks to the widespread ownership of handheld gadgets.Indonesian netizen’s eagerness in using social media reflects the nation’s culture of participation in the digital era. In early 2017, Twitter reported Indonesia was the fifth country of Twitter users, with some  4.1 billion tweets sent from the country. Both trends indicate a high degree of activity and intense flow of online (accessible) content which at any rates are searchable worldwide through tracking a line of hashtag.The apparent fondness of engaging in public debate and reacting to the political narrative via social media substantiates a premise that highly political matter is not only a theme of discussion raised by high-profile policy makers, but cascading down to everyday conversation among ordinary citizens.  This reality is nevertheless susceptible to the irresponsible and derogatory content attributable to meme’s anonymous nature.Some years ago,  ideas or aspirations were best presented by the pressure of interest groups, political parties or  fractions in the legislature largely due to their ingrained power in persuading and mobilizing the masses. With the advent of digital communication the origin of social change initially driven by ideas is no longer sourced from the formal, hierarchical and structured institution. Instead, internet has capacitated individuals to pitch their own opinion, initiate a movement, and land themselves in a circumstance equally influential to that of formal political forces.Internet memes feed the cyberspace with ideas, a subtle movement, and political campaign. Meme diffusion which  easily escalates from a content merely shared by an individual to an item rapidly consumed by masses, highlights an important feature of broad reachability and friendliness to all segments of society, which is essential for political framing. As noted by Shifman, memes encapsulate a pot of ideas, communicative technique, and textually powerful social interaction.The researchers Colin Lankshear and Michele Knobel take memes even more seriously; though meme’s coverage is at the micro level (individual-to-individual), its repercussion is larger than its scope of diffusion. It can shape mindsets, social behavior and attitudes of numerous social groups.Meme functions as a presenter of ideas that conceals or clearly pitches a subjective interest.Take a viral meme created on Susi Pudjiastuti, the popular Fisheries and Marine Affairs Minister. Her campaign on consuming fish for a healthy diet is made into a meme with a twist on her campaign against illegal fishing: “… anyone who doesn’t eat fish, I will sink them”. A jargon, tagline, motto, and a short quote on a picture sums up a key message  at the end.The underlying issue of market sustainability in fisheries is a complex process involving supply and demand balancing effort, national purchasing power, and maritime culture cultivation that entails problem solving. One solution is promoting fish consumption across the nation, also for the population’s health. Indeed, the promotion is at the heart of government’s interest, which received huge public response. Susi’s popularity appeared to increase; the meme seemed to have successfully helped the government policy in promoting fish consumption.Meme flourishes because it benefits from internet penetration and regular use of social networking sites: shareability and readability. Passing a meme to others is not burdensome. Meanwhile an immense degree of readability occurs when even the most digitally-illiterate people can still access the meaning ascribed to a meme. Both aspects have made meme popularly circulated amongst citizens.</h2><br />

                            33. 10 THINGS EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE do not DO 
Emotional intelligence is probably the most powerful yet undervalued trait in our society. 
We believe in rooting our everyday functions in logic and reason, yet we come to the same conclusions after long periods of contemplation as we do in the blink of an eye4. Our leaders sorely overlook the human element of our sociopolitical issues and I need not cite the divorce rate for you to believe that we're not choosing the right partners (nor do we have the capacity to sustain intimate relationships for long periods of time). 
It seems people believe the most intelligent thing to do is not have emotions at all. To be effective is to be a machine, a product of the age. A well-oiled, consumerist-serving, digitally attuned, highly unaware but overtly operational robot. And so we suffer. 
Here are the habits of the people who have the capacity to be aware of what they feel. Who know how to express, process, dismantle, and adjust their experience as they are their own locus of control. They are the true leaders, they are living the most whole and genuine lives, and it is from them we should be taking a cue. These are the things that emotionally intelligent people do not do. 
01. They don't assume that the way they think and feel about a situation is the way it is in reality, nor how it will turn out in the end. They recognize their emotions as responses, not accurate gauges, of what's going on. They accept that those responses may have to do with their own issues, rather than the objective situation at hand. 
02. Their emotional base points are not external. 
Their emotions aren't "somebody else's doing," and therefore "somebody else's problem to resolve." Understanding that they are</h2><br />
