We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun</p>Evidence: Michelle gave the writer love<p></p><p>3. It's hard to die when all the birds are singing in the sky.</p>Meaning: The writer has such a loving and caring family. So it's hard for the writer to just die.<p></p><p>4. Michelle is probably the writer's son / husband. As we can see from the text, Michelle gave the writer love. </p>The intention: The writer was depressed, the writer wanted to die.

If we look really closely, she's like speaking not to just the writer's family, but to also communicate with the dead ones. Think of it, the writer said in the text ➽ "We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
. But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time" That's like referring to the writer's past! And in the past, something tragic did happened to her.</p><p></p><p>10. Try to spend the most time with family. Don't take family for granted. Now, the writer experienced something really bad. But the writer still had family. But the pain that was causing her, makes her even more desperate to die. (Must've been really painful). </p><p></p><p><strong>Don't take family for granted.
