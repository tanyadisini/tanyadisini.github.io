Read the following text!
The latest round in an ongoing debate over global-warming trends claims that warming has indeed slowed down this century. An obvious slowing in the rise of global temperatures was recorded at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This was referred to as a "hiatus" or a "pause". This hiatus was first observed several years ago. Climate-change skeptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped permanently. But in June the previous year, a study in science claimed that the hiatus was just an artifact which disappears when biases in temperature data are corrected.
Now a prominent group of researchers is countering that claim. They argue in Nature Climate Change that even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real. "There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing," says lead author John Fyfe. "We can't ignore it." Fyfe uses the term "slowdown" rather than "hiatus". He also stresses that it does not in any way weaken global-warming theory.
The study that questioned the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record maintained by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The finding showed differences in temperature readings from ships and buoys. This effectively increased the record about warming. The researchers also extended the record to include 2014. This set a new record high for average temperatures.
Thomas Karl, director of National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, calculated the rate of global warming between 1950 and 1999 as being 0.113°C per decade. This was similar to the 0.116°C a decade calculated for 2000-14. This, Karl said, meant that an assessment done by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 showing that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
1. The passage above mainly discusses about….
a. the hiatus observation was first carried out several years ago
b. the reason why global warming is slowing down in this century
c. global warming is a verifiable issue in the space of a decade
d. the contention about global warming and whether it is indeed slowing this period
e. the view of study in science that the hiatus is an artifact which vanishes
The word "prominent" in paragraph 2 means….
a. well-known
b. promenade
c. shrewd
d. indolent
e. magnificent
3. Why have some claimed that global warming a fabricated issue?
1. Because there’s no valid data to prove that global warming is real.
2. Since the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record upheld by the US NOAA.
3. As an assessment done on Climate Change presenting that warming had slowed was no longer valid.

Those in the retail industry that are successful in digitally transforming will be ones that leverage technology to innovate around an immersive and disruptive customer experience. These "lighthouse" retailers are the ones driving innovation, adopting emerging technologies early, and showing the industry what works and is possible. They are the ones experimenting with new models and store formats, playing with recombinations/reconfigurations of scale, assets, product, place, and people. The "store of the future" is the keystone of this effort.
The store of the future will combine multiple formats to deliver an immersive and unique experience across all customer touchpoints online and in the store. It will be heavily instrumented for operational efficiency and digitally connected end-to-end to leverage a single view of customer, product, and order. The store of the future – despite its reliance on sophisticated technology and infrastructure – will be trying to look smaller and less intimidating, more personalized, and frictionless.
The deployment of these and other digital technologies in disruptive ways can turn visitors into shoppers and shoppers into brand-loyal customers. However, understanding which consumers want personalization and which want contextualized and relevant experiences, while protecting everyone’s privacy, has grown more difficult. With so much at stake, data privacy has become a challenge for every party involved.

The Eiffel Tower is located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. Built in 1889, it has become both a global icon of France and one of the most recognizable building in the world.
It is the highest building in Paris and the most-visited monument in the world. Millions of people visit it every year. The engineer Gustave Eifell came up with his name for this tower. It was built as the entrance arch to the 1889 World’s Fair.
The tower is 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall, and has height as an 80-storey building. Upon its completion, it is higher than the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world. The title is held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York city was built in 1930. But due to the addition of antenna in 1957, the tower is now higher than the Chrysler Building and it is the second-tallest structure in France after the 2004.

A kangaroo is an animal found only in Australia. It has a smaller relative, called a wallaby, which lives on the Australian Island of Tasmania and in New Guinea.
Kangaroos eat grass and plants. They have short front legs, but very long and strong back legs and a tail. These are used for sitting up and for jumping. Kangaroos have been known to make forward jumps of over eight meters, and leap across fences more than three meters high. They can also run at speeds of over 45 kilometers per hour.
The largest kangaroos are the Great grey kangaroo and the Red Kangaroo. Adult grows to a length of 1.60 meters and weighs over 90 kilos.
Kangaroos are marsupials. This means that the female kangaroo has an external pouch on the front of her body. A baby kangaroo is very tiny when it is born, and it crawls at once into this pouch where it spends its first five months of life.

It was raining heavily and they had to open the windows of their car and put their heads out to see better. Suddenly Mary had an idea. In 1869, Thomas Adams was trying to produce rubber out of the juice he got from Mexican sapodilla trees. He wanted to produce toys, rain boots and bicycle tyres. The experiment didn’t work. While he was thinking about this, he took a piece of the rubber he was working with and put it in his mouth. In 1897, British inventor James Henry Atkinson was looking at the family’s supply of potatoes, which they kept in a room under their house. He noticed that mice had eaten some of the potatoes so he invented something that he called ‘Little Nipper’ to stop them.In 1886, Josephine Cochran was standing in her kitchen in Illinois, USA. The family lunch was fi nished. There was a mountain of dishes in front of Mrs Cochran and she got quite angry, thinking that she had to do this job every day. ‘If nobody else is going to invent a machine for this, I’ll do it myself,’ she thought.

Galileo developeda superior telescope and made many significant discoveries in astronomy. He wassentenced to life imprisonment by the inquisition for his support for theCopernican theory that the sun was at the centre of the solar system.Galileo was born in Florence, Italy in 1564 to a poor but noble family. His parents recognized theirchild’s innate intelligence and talents and so made sacrifices to have himeducated. At his father’s insistence, Galileo studied the profitable career ofmedicine. But, at the University of Pisa, Galileo became fascinated in a widerange of subjects. He was also critical of many of Aristotle’s teaching whichhad dominated education for the past 2,000 years.Galileo was appointed to be a mathematics professor at the University ofPisa, but his strident criticisms of Aristotle left him isolated among hiscontemporaries. After three years of persecution, he resigned and went to theUniversity of Padua, where he taught math. His entertaining lectures attracteda large following and he was able to spend the next 18 years pursuing hisinterests in astronomy and mechanics.Source:http://englishadmin.com/2018/12/50-contoh-soal-recount-text-biography-dan-jawaban.htmlAfter reading the text, answer these questions:1.

The question is based on the following text.
(The story by Oiwan Lam originally appeared on Global Voices, on December 2, 2020)
Over a dozen journalists resigned on December 1 from Hong Kong Cable Television Limited, a major subscription-based TV station in Hong Kong, in protest after the media company fired 40 editorial staff in what is perceived as a political crackdown. Those laid off include the head of the China desk and the entire team of the award-winning News Lancet program. The broadcaster cited financial reasons for the layoff, a claim the newsroom staff rebukes. The entire China desk, a total of 12 people, has since resigned in protest, along with the heads of the international and finance desks and the newsroom's chief assignment editor.
The layoffs were sudden and took immediate effect — those who were sacked were told to leave the office on the same day. In shock, members of staff gathered outside the room of the news director demanding an explanation. Among those laid off is Wong Lai-ping, former deputy news editor at the China desk. On a radio interview aired on December 2, she rebuked the management's claim that the decision was made out of financial difficulties, remarking that in August, the management fired the then-executive director Fung Tak-hung and replaced him with four new managers. Wong said that the new management often made editorial requests, such as live broadcasts of China's foreign minister's regular press conference, or modifying headlines. According to Wong, the newsroom staff refused to comply with such requests.
The Hong Kong Journalists Association commented on the layoffs, "Given the [New Lancet] team’s coverage of the police and administration, it’s difficult not to see this as minimizing sensitive reporting in the name of cost-cutting".
1. Based on the text, the trigger of this resignation en masse is the belief that ….
a. the previous layoffs were politically motivated
b. financial reasons affected the layoffs the most
c. the journalists could demand for higher salary
d. political crackdown barely prompted the layoffs
e. the management's disapproved of staffs' refusal of demands
2. Dealing with the issue discussed in the text, the statement above may lead the readers to the assumption that …
a. The management’s claim should have been accepted by all parties.
b. The decision to fire Fung Tak-hung was taken with well-consideration.
c. The director Fung Tak-hung was not as competent as four new managers.
d. There was an illogical situation to claim financial difficulties as the reason for the layoffs.
e. The management tried to cover up their financial difficulties by cutting the number of employees.</a>

Read the following text!
The latest round in an ongoing debate over global-warming trends claims that warming has indeed slowed down this century. An obvious slowing in the rise of global temperatures was recorded at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This was referred to as a "hiatus" or a "pause". This hiatus was first observed several years ago. Climate-change skeptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped permanently. But in June the previous year, a study in science claimed that the hiatus was just an artifact which disappears when biases in temperature data are corrected.
Now a prominent group of researchers is countering that claim. They argue in Nature Climate Change that even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real. "There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing," says lead author John Fyfe. "We can't ignore it." Fyfe uses the term "slowdown" rather than "hiatus". He also stresses that it does not in any way weaken global-warming theory.
The study that questioned the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record maintained by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The finding showed differences in temperature readings from ships and buoys. This effectively increased the record about warming. The researchers also extended the record to include 2014. This set a new record high for average temperatures.
Thomas Karl, director of National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, calculated the rate of global warming between 1950 and 1999 as being 0.113°C per decade. This was similar to the 0.116°C a decade calculated for 2000-14. This, Karl said, meant that an assessment done by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 showing that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
1. The passage above mainly discusses about….
a. the hiatus observation was first carried out several years ago
b. the reason why global warming is slowing down in this century
c. global warming is a verifiable issue in the space of a decade
d. the contention about global warming and whether it is indeed slowing this period
e. the view of study in science that the hiatus is an artifact which vanishes
The word "prominent" in paragraph 2 means….
a. well-known
b. promenade
c. shrewd
d. indolent
e. magnificent
3. Why have some claimed that global warming a fabricated issue?
1. Because there’s no valid data to prove that global warming is real.
2. Since the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record upheld by the US NOAA.
3. As an assessment done on Climate Change presenting that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
4. For the researchers is countering that in Nature Climate Change even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real.

Those in the retail industry that are successful in digitally transforming will be ones that leverage technology to innovate around an immersive and disruptive customer experience. These "lighthouse" retailers are the ones driving innovation, adopting emerging technologies early, and showing the industry what works and is possible. They are the ones experimenting with new models and store formats, playing with recombinations/reconfigurations of scale, assets, product, place, and people. The "store of the future" is the keystone of this effort.
The store of the future will combine multiple formats to deliver an immersive and unique experience across all customer touchpoints online and in the store. It will be heavily instrumented for operational efficiency and digitally connected end-to-end to leverage a single view of customer, product, and order. The store of the future – despite its reliance on sophisticated technology and infrastructure – will be trying to look smaller and less intimidating, more personalized, and frictionless.
The deployment of these and other digital technologies in disruptive ways can turn visitors into shoppers and shoppers into brand-loyal customers. However, understanding which consumers want personalization and which want contextualized and relevant experiences, while protecting everyone’s privacy, has grown more difficult. With so much at stake, data privacy has become a challenge for every party involved.

The Eiffel Tower is located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. Built in 1889, it has become both a global icon of France and one of the most recognizable building in the world.
It is the highest building in Paris and the most-visited monument in the world. Millions of people visit it every year. The engineer Gustave Eifell came up with his name for this tower. It was built as the entrance arch to the 1889 World’s Fair.
The tower is 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall, and has height as an 80-storey building.

A kangaroo is an animal found only in Australia. It has a smaller relative, called a wallaby, which lives on the Australian Island of Tasmania and in New Guinea.
Kangaroos eat grass and plants. They have short front legs, but very long and strong back legs and a tail. These are used for sitting up and for jumping. Kangaroos have been known to make forward jumps of over eight meters, and leap across fences more than three meters high. They can also run at speeds of over 45 kilometers per hour.
The largest kangaroos are the Great grey kangaroo and the Red Kangaroo. Adult grows to a length of 1.60 meters and weighs over 90 kilos.

                            36. In 1903, Mary Anderson and a friend were driving to New York. It was raining heavily and they had to open the windows of their car and put their heads out to see better. Suddenly Mary had an idea. In 1869, Thomas Adams was trying to produce rubber out of the juice he got from Mexican sapodilla trees. He wanted to produce toys, rain boots and bicycle tyres. The experiment didn’t work. While he was thinking about this, he took a piece of the rubber he was working with and put it in his mouth. In 1897, British inventor James Henry Atkinson was looking at the family’s supply of potatoes, which they kept in a room under their house. He noticed that mice had eaten some of the potatoes so he invented something that he called ‘Little Nipper’ to stop them.In 1886, Josephine Cochran was standing in her kitchen in Illinois, USA. The family lunch was fi nished. There was a mountain of dishes in front of Mrs Cochran and she got quite angry, thinking that she had to do this job every day. ‘If nobody else is going to invent a machine for this, I’ll do it myself,’ she thought. In the early years of the eighteenth century, in the middle of the summer, an unknown Dutchman was looking at one of the many canals in Holland. He was thinking that he often travelled along the frozen canals on ice skates in the winter. He got a little impatient. ‘I don’t want to wait for winter!’ he thought.soal buat 1 contoh kalimat dari teks tsb yg merupakan past tense dan past continuous kemudian berikan rangkuman minimal 5 kalimat?(soal buku cambridge second edition hal 12)​</h2><br />

His parents recognized theirchild’s innate intelligence and talents and so made sacrifices to have himeducated. At his father’s insistence, Galileo studied the profitable career ofmedicine. But, at the University of Pisa, Galileo became fascinated in a widerange of subjects. He was also critical of many of Aristotle’s teaching whichhad dominated education for the past 2,000 years.Galileo was appointed to be a mathematics professor at the University ofPisa, but his strident criticisms of Aristotle left him isolated among hiscontemporaries.

The question is based on the following text.
(The story by Oiwan Lam originally appeared on Global Voices, on December 2, 2020)
Over a dozen journalists resigned on December 1 from Hong Kong Cable Television Limited, a major subscription-based TV station in Hong Kong, in protest after the media company fired 40 editorial staff in what is perceived as a political crackdown. Those laid off include the head of the China desk and the entire team of the award-winning News Lancet program. The broadcaster cited financial reasons for the layoff, a claim the newsroom staff rebukes. The entire China desk, a total of 12 people, has since resigned in protest, along with the heads of the international and finance desks and the newsroom's chief assignment editor.
The layoffs were sudden and took immediate effect — those who were sacked were told to leave the office on the same day. In shock, members of staff gathered outside the room of the news director demanding an explanation. Among those laid off is Wong Lai-ping, former deputy news editor at the China desk. On a radio interview aired on December 2, she rebuked the management's claim that the decision was made out of financial difficulties, remarking that in August, the management fired the then-executive director Fung Tak-hung and replaced him with four new managers. Wong said that the new management often made editorial requests, such as live broadcasts of China's foreign minister's regular press conference, or modifying headlines. According to Wong, the newsroom staff refused to comply with such requests.
The Hong Kong Journalists Association commented on the layoffs, "Given the [New Lancet] team’s coverage of the police and administration, it’s difficult not to see this as minimizing sensitive reporting in the name of cost-cutting".
