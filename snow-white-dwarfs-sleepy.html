                                            Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Snow White. She lived with her aunt and uncle because her parents were dead.
One day she heard her uncle and aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White.
Snow White didn’t want her uncle and aunt to do that so she decided that it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away into the woods. She was very tired and hungry. Then she saw a little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep.
Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs.
The dwarfs said, “What is your name?”
Snow White said, “My name is Snow White.”
Then, Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story.
The dwarfs said, “If you want, you may live here with us.”
Snow White answered, “Oh, could I? Thank you.”
Finally, Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.

a.Her parents passed away
b. Her uncle was angry with her
 c.Her uncle and aunt would go to America
 d.Snow White was happy to run away</a>

                            7. Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Snow White. She lived with her aunt and uncle because her parents were dead.
One day she heard her uncle and aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White.
Snow White didn’t want her uncle and aunt to do that so she decided that it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away into the woods. She was very tired and hungry. Then she saw a little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep.
Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs.
The dwarfs said, “What is your name?”
Snow White said, “My name is Snow White.”
Then, Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story.
The dwarfs said, “If you want, you may live here with us.”
Snow White answered, “Oh, could I? Thank you.”
Finally, Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.
