Upon its completion, it surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930; however, due to the addition in 1957 of the antenna, the tower is now taller than the Chrysler Building. Not including broadcast antennas, it is the second-tallest structure in France after the 2004 Millau Viaduct.<br /><br />   The tower has three levels for visitors. Tickets can be purchased to ascend, by stairs or lift, to the first and second levels. The walk to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the walk from the first to the second level.

                        The National Monument (Indonesian: Monumen Nasional (Monas)) is a 433 ft (132 metre) tower in the centre of Merdeka Square, Central Jakarta, symbolizing the fight for Indonesia's independence. Construction began in 1961 under the direction of President Sukarno and the monument was opened to the public in 1975. It is topped by a flame covered with gold foil. <br /><br />The monument and the museum is open daily from 08.00 - 15.00 Western Indonesia Time (UTC+7), everyday throughout the week, except for the last Monday of each month, when the monument is closed. The main Sudirman-Thamrin avenues in Jakarta lead to the Merdeka Square, where in its center stands the National Monument (also known as Monas--Monumen Nasional) which houses the first red-and-white flag flown at the Proclamation of Independence on 17 August 1945. This flag has now become threadbare, and so nowadays on Independence Day ceremonies, the original flag is taken out but only to accompany the replica flag to be flown in front of the Merdeka Palace. The 137 meter tall National Monument is obelisk shaped, and is topped with a 14.5 meter bronze flame coated with 32 kilograms gold leaf. Within the pedestal is a museum depicting in diorama Indonesia’s fight for Independence as well as the original text of the Proclamation of Independence. A lift takes visitors up to the look-out platform at the base of the flame for a grand view of Jakarta. Surrounding the Monument is now a park with a musical fountain, enjoyed by the Jakarta public on Sundays for sports and recreation.<br /><br /><br />Deer roam among the shady trees in the park. Merdeka Square is the center of most important government buildings. During Dutch colonial days here was the center of government, known as Koningsplein or the King’s Square. The north side is dominated by the Merdeka Palace once the home of the Dutch Governor Generals, which now also houses the office of the President and the Cabinet. To the South is the office of Indonesia’s Vice President, Jakarta’s Governor and provincial parliament building, as also the American Embassy , while to the West is the National Museum, the Constitutional Court, the Ministry for Culture and Tourism and the Indosat building, Indonesia’s first international telecommunications company.<br />

                        B.J. Habibie<br /><br />Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie is the third President of Indonesia. He was born on June 25, 1936 in Pare-Pare, South Sulawesi. He is the fourth of eight children in his family. His parents are Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie and RA. Tuti Marini Puspowardojo. He spent his childhood in Pare-Pare. Since he was a kid, he has shown his integrity and persistent behaviour. At school, Habibie whose hobbies are riding horse and reading book is famous for his intelligence.<br /><br />Habibie’s father passed away due to heart attack when he was in elementary school. After that, his mother sold their vehicle and house and then moved to Bandung. As a single parent, Habibie’s mother worked hard to afford her life with her children.<br /><br />In 1954, after Habibie graduated from senior high school in Bandung, he continued his study to Bandung Institute of Technology. He did not finish his study at ITB because at the same time he got a scholarship from The Ministry of education and Culture of Indonesia to study in Germany. He remembered that Bung Karno had ever said about the importance of plane development for Indonesia, and then he decided to take aerospace engineering with aeroplane construction specialty at Rhein Westfalen Aachen Technische Hochschule (RWTH), an institute of technology in Germany.<br />Habibie studied hard to be success since he remembered how hard his mother worked for his life. Even, Habibie spent his time in holiday to earn extra money for buying books. When holiday ended, he did not do anything except studying. In 1960, he graduated with great score, almost perfect (9.5). With his education background, he applied at an industry company of train, named Firma Talbot.<br /><br />After that, he continued his doctoral degree at Technische Hochschule Die Facultaet Fuer Maschinenwesen Aachean. In 1962, he got married with Hasri Ainun. She was a doctor and she followed his husband to Germany. Habibie and Ainun has two sons. They are Ilham Akbar dan Thareq Kemal. At that time, life got harder. He had to go to work in the early morning because he walked to the office to save more money. He went home in the evening and studied. He finished his doctoral degree in 1965 with perfect score (10).<br /><br />In his life, Habibie has got many achievements and awards from Indonesia and other International institution. Before he fulfilled a call from President Soeharto and went back to Indonesia, he had worked at a leading aeroplane industry, MBB Gmbh, Germany. In Indonesia, Habibie had been the minister of Research and Technology for 20 years and led 10 governmental company of strategic industry. He was elected by society representative assembly as the Vice President of Indonesia. When the crisis happened in 1998 and President Soeharto was insisted to step down from his position, Habibie was assigned to replace President Soeharto to be the third President of Indonesia.<br />In 2012, the life of Habibie and how he met Ainun were filmed and got high rates for the inspirational story. Hasri Ainun passed away on May 22, 2010 in Ludwig Maximilians Universitat hospital, Klinikum, Muenchen, Germany. She suffered a cancer for a long time however she never told her husband, Habibie. It was known that she had cancer when she collapsed and had to be hospitalized. For Habibie, Ainun is everything. She is a great partner of life who had accompanied him to go through good and bad times in life.<br />
