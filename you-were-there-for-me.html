Now that I am a mother, I'm realizing just what you went through with me. You were always so patient and kind even when you had to sacrifice what you were doing to help me. I admire your intelligence. I know you gave up your dreams of being a pharmacist when I came along I can't imagine all the dreams you actually gave up just for me and because of me, but I am glad you are my momWhenever I had faced hard times in school, you were there to encourage me. Learning how to make friends, dealing with hurts, feeling alone, and learning how to navigate through the craziness of growing up-I knew I could turn to you for answersWhat I appreciate is that you wouldn't just see what I went through and just tell me what to doThe point is that you would actually take time out of your day to listen to me and my problems. I do that with my daughter now, and I realize how much I love doing this.Thank you for your example to me. Again, I love you and Happy Mother's Day.Lots of love,Seo Ye Ji​</a>

-
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you</a>

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I’ll be forever thankful, baby
You’re the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You’re the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn’t speak
You were my eyes when I couldn’t see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn’t reach
You gave me faith ’cause you believed
I’m everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I’m grateful for each day you gave me</a>

                                            Dear Alya,In today’s fast world it is difficult to find a true friend like you. I sometimes think I am very lucky to get you. Life would have been very boring without you.I still remember the first day of school when we were young,you called me and gave a seat beside you. It’s now almost 15 years and our relationship have grown in past years. I would like to thank you for being there for me for the ups and downs of my life.Last year when my father passed away you were a support to me and my family. I don’t know what I would have done without you then. You were more helpful than my relatives. I can never forget how you stayed back in the hospital late night just to support me and my mother. I cherish every moment of life we spent together.Though you are away from me I still feel that you are close to me. How are your studies going? Last time when you wrote you seemed little worried about the portions. I know you will easily pass your engineering also with flying colors. Where are you next holidays? I am eagerly waiting to meet you and spend some good time together.Lovereyna  ​</a>

-
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you</a>

2. What do you think about this song regarding the recent condition?
Heal the World
Song by Michael Jackson
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me
If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living
The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
You and for me</a>

you've given me
I'll always keep it inside
You're the driving force in my life, yeah
There isn't anything or anyone that I can be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side
You were there for me to love and care for me when skies were gray
Whenever I was down, you were always there to comfort me
And no one else can be what you have been
to me, you'll always be
You will always be the girl in my life for all
times.

                            5. bang tolong jawab plisssDear Mom,.D. independent and entertainingHappy Mother's Day! Now that I am a mother, I'm realizing just what you went through with me. You were always so patient and kind even when you had to sacrifice what you were doing to help me. I admire your intelligence. I know you gave up your dreams of being a pharmacist when I came along I can't imagine all the dreams you actually gave up just for me and because of me, but I am glad you are my momWhenever I had faced hard times in school, you were there to encourage me. Learning how to make friends, dealing with hurts, feeling alone, and learning how to navigate through the craziness of growing up-I knew I could turn to you for answersWhat I appreciate is that you wouldn't just see what I went through and just tell me what to doThe point is that you would actually take time out of your day to listen to me and my problems. I do that with my daughter now, and I realize how much I love doing this.Thank you for your example to me. Again, I love you and Happy Mother's Day.Lots of love,Seo Ye Ji​</h2><br />

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you</h2><br />

For all the love I found in you
I’ll be forever thankful, baby
You’re the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You’re the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn’t speak
You were my eyes when I couldn’t see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn’t reach
You gave me faith ’cause you believed
I’m everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I’m grateful for each day you gave me</h2><br />

                            28. Dear Alya,In today’s fast world it is difficult to find a true friend like you. I sometimes think I am very lucky to get you. Life would have been very boring without you.I still remember the first day of school when we were young,you called me and gave a seat beside you. It’s now almost 15 years and our relationship have grown in past years. I would like to thank you for being there for me for the ups and downs of my life.Last year when my father passed away you were a support to me and my family. I don’t know what I would have done without you then. You were more helpful than my relatives. I can never forget how you stayed back in the hospital late night just to support me and my mother. I cherish every moment of life we spent together.Though you are away from me I still feel that you are close to me. How are your studies going? Last time when you wrote you seemed little worried about the portions. I know you will easily pass your engineering also with flying colors. Where are you next holidays? I am eagerly waiting to meet you and spend some good time together.Lovereyna  ​</h2><br />

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you</h2><br />

2. What do you think about this song regarding the recent condition?
Heal the World
Song by Michael Jackson
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me
If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living
The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
You and for me</h2><br />
                        As is known, the meaning of the lyrics of the song Heal The World feels very relevant to the condition of the inhabitants of the earth today, who are both struggling against the corona virus.<br />
